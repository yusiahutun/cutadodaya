Chinese rice cakes, or niangao, are made from pounded rice and have a sticky, chewy texture.

Like pasta, they possess almost no flavour by themselves, but when cooked with sauces they retain their chewy texture and absorb their complementary favours.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese rice cakes, or niangao, are made from pounded rice and have a sticky, chewy texture. Niangao’s origin story may date back to as many as 2,500 years ago to Suzhou during a chaotic period of war, which lasted from 722 to 481BC. The Wu Kingdom’s prime minister was first credited with shaping glutinous rice flour into bricklike shapes and saving his people from starvation when his kingdom was besieged.&nbsp;</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Restaurants closed for Lunar New Year?

During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, niangao became a common staple, with different varieties developed in the north and south.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/02/11/ab1029f8-4570-4b1f-968a-9b72082424ae_ed18453d.jpg>One notable recipe found in southern China, particularly in Shanghai, involves stir-frying flat rice cakes with sliced pork, leafy greens and a sweet-savoury sauce consisting of soy sauce and sugar. While rice cakes can be eaten all year round, they are traditionally regarded as <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">special dishes shared during Lunar New Year reunion meals</span></a>, representing good luck and fortune as niangao is a homonym for “higher year”.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, literally translated as “stir-fried rice cake”, tteokbokki is a popular Korean street food that is made with small-sized garaetteok. Unlike the Chinese version that is sliced and flat, garaetteok is a long and cylindrically-shaped tteok, or rice cake, and has a significantly chewier bite than its Chinese counterpart.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/02/11/7893c615-50ac-4ed8-9d95-b98600fbc38a_cdb18fc9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The first references to tteok appeared in several books about wars between China and Korea that took place between 480 and 222BC. The books told of washed rice that was pounded into a powder and mixed with water, before being shaped into flat discs that were steamed.&nbsp;</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">K-pop stars’ favourite foods and Korean dishes revealed</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To draw focus on the rice cakes’ chewy texture, tteokbokki is served with minimal garnish and side ingredients. The rice cakes are boiled and coated in a red sauce of gochujang (chilli paste), gochugaru (red pepper flakes), soy sauce, sugar and sesame seeds. Some home-made recipes include sliced eomuk (flat fish cake), cabbage and scallions.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/02/11/b1179949-bbc7-4b27-a80a-b5443dd1b3f6_ed18453d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Spicy tteokbokki is generally acknowledged to have a more recent origin. Developed in 1953, the year the Korean war ended, the recipe can be traced back to a woman in Seoul who made the rice cakes with gochujang sauce as an affordable comfort snack.&nbsp;</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">5 items cleared from shelves after appearing on the Bangtan Bomb YouTube series</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A Korean rice cake dish that is similar to Chinese niangao is the Gungjung Tteokbokki, or royal court rice cakes. As its name suggests, the traditional dish dates back to the Joseon Dynasty and was a key aspect of royal cuisine. In contrast to the modern spicy version commonly found on street stalls, Gungjung Tteokbokki is stir-fried with sliced meat, vegetables and a mild soy-based sauce.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although rice cakes are now commonly served in both countries, there is no doubt that rice cakes share long and illustrious histories in both countries. They will surely continue to play important roles in Chinese and Korean traditions for future generations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Want more stories like this?
