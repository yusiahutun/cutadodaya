But she took a moment to post her gratitude to social media:</p><p>"She sent us the song," LBT's Kimberly Schlapman reveals to&nbsp;Taste of Country. "We were like, 'Wow! Taylor sent us a song. She's one of the best songwriters ever.'"</p><p>After listening repeatedly,&nbsp;they were in love, and they decided they wouldn't ask any questions about the song or why Swift sent it to them. Little Big Town&nbsp;don't know who the country-turned-pop singer had in mind when she wrote the digging lyrics of "Better Man."</p><p>"That chorus ... from the first time I heard it, I fell in love with it," Jimi Westbrook says. "It's so built for our harmonies, and that's probably why, maybe, she thought of us."</p><p>Swift's album Reputation is scheduled for release Nov. 10. Little Big Town additionally won the Vocal&nbsp;Group of the Year award at the 2017 CMA Awards.</p><p><strong>See Pics from the 2017 CMA Awards Red Carpet</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXaeyoq%2FTrGSbnaSpsrN5zJqlZqufo7Ruu8Vmq6GdXa6yor6Ma2dqb12YuqJ5wLCYq5yjZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./save-images-from-google-slides.html><span>←</span><span>How to Save Images From Google Slides</span></a>
