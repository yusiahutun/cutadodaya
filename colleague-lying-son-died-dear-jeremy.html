We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma – what are your thoughts?</strong></p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>My dilemma is that I have recently proved that my colleague has lied and is continuing to lie about the death of her 22-year-old son.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>She announced three months ago that her son had been battling lymphoma for the past two years and that his death was imminent. A month later she told us he had passed away. As colleagues we have been on a rollercoaster of emotions and have offered support, love and comfort to a grieving mother while she remained at work in an effort to cling on to normality.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>Since her son’s “death” this colleague has made comments that made me doubt that her situation was genuine. After a little research I have proved that her son is very much alive and away studying at university.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>My colleagues seem to be unaware of her lie and continue to be pulled into her web of deceit.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>I feel she has taken advantage of our compassion and continues to abuse our trust. She has used this situation to make demands at work, such as a decrease in hours.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>If I don’t say anything then the lie continues, but if I decide to tackle it I am unsure as to what course of action to take.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9>I am worried how I will be perceived by management and colleagues for doubting and researching her life. She is a well-liked member of the team and they will be shocked and hurt.</p><p class=dcr-1fp5gi9><strong>Do you need advice on a work issue?
