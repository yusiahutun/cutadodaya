Moreover, he is also commonly known for his work on NBC and MSNBC.&nbsp;He has earned several awards from his profession as a journalist. Let’s find out is Don Lemon married?, is Don Lemon gay?, and Quick Facts</h3><h2><span id=Is_Don_Lemon_Married_Know_about_his_Partner_Boyfriend_or_husband>Is Don Lemon Married? Know about his Partner, Boyfriend or husband</span></h2><p>Once there was a rumor that Don Lemon was married to <strong>Stephanie Ortiz</strong>, but this information has long remained a rumor because it was never confirmed by them. Since he publicly declared himself as a gay, the information seemed to be very far from the truth.&nbsp;The news that is more credible is the one that says that Don is married to his boyfriend <strong>John Byrne</strong> who is a choreographer.</p>Caption: Don Lemon with his Boyfriend, Tim<p>In the year 2017, it was rumored that Don Lemon was dating <strong>Tim Malone&nbsp;</strong>who&nbsp;is&nbsp;a sales executive and the couple was pictured together holding hands in public. During the celebration of New Year 2018, he kissed Tim in front of his co-anchor,&nbsp;<strong>Brooke Baldwin</strong>&nbsp;which was shared on his official Twitter account. Currently, the couple is living a happy and blissful life together.</p><h2><span id=Is_Don_Lemon_Gay>Is Don Lemon Gay?</span></h2><p>Is Don Lemon Gay? well, Don Lemon’s sexuality was a mystery until he was on his 20s. But while he turned&nbsp;30, he disclosed that he is gay. In his new book titled&nbsp;Transparent, he&nbsp;talks to the public about his life and sexuality and in an interview with the New York Times.&nbsp;By his actions, he has joined the league of gay anchors on TV which includes&nbsp;<strong>Thomas Roberts</strong> and <strong>Rachel Maddow</strong> from MSNBC.</p><p>Moreover, his book was initially meant to be an inspirational piece but as he worked on it, he was motivated to go public with his sexuality. Don became very scared at one point and almost removed the part of his book that talked about his sexuality. Because he knows that people might avoid him for it, especially the black community. He said that it would really be great if every gay person comes out to openly declare their sexuality.</p><p>However, Don had the courage to tell his family about his sexuality. But his family has already accepted it. After going public with his gay status, Don seems to have become the new gay role model.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts_of_Don_Lemon>Quick Facts of Don Lemon</span></h2><ul><li>Don Lemon was born on <strong>1st March 1966</strong>, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to parents <strong>Katherine Clark</strong>(mother) and <strong>Mr. Richardson</strong>(father).</li><li>As of 2019, he is 53 years old and his birth sign is Pisces.</li><li>He was raised along with his sisters,&nbsp;<strong>Yma</strong>, and <strong>Leisa</strong> in West Baton Rouge and Port Allen.</li><li>Don Lemon has an estimated net worth of around<strong> $3 million</strong>.</li><li>He stands at an average height of 5 feet 6 inches.</li><li>Don Lemon is active on various social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.</li></ul><p>Also, Read about David Muir Bio, Salary Net Worth, and is David Muir gay?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0sL%2FSoqdnm5%2BifKW7zWajnqWfo3qordhmpJqqop6ypXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bekah-martinez.html><span>←</span><span>Bekah Martinez - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Facts, Career</span></a>
