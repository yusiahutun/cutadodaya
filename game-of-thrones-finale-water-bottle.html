According to screenshots shared on Twitter, the drinking vessel was found in the scene where the great houses of Westeros meet in King's Landing, behind Samwell Tarly's (John Bradley) foot as he and other guests discuss who should take the crown. (To be specific, it appears at around 46:19 in Season 8, Episode 6, "The Iron Throne.")</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The bottle's cameo isn't as obvious as the infamous coffee cup's in Episode 4, only a sliver peeks out from behind Sam's boot, but it's still visible enough to get the Twitterverse talking.</p><br data-node-id=14><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One viewer even said there was another bottle placed behind Ser Davos and Lord Gendry's chairs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After the Game of Thrones team left the coffee cup in the banquet scene two episodes ago, fans were so outraged that HBO responded with an official statement. "The latte that appeared in the episode was a mistake. Daenerys had ordered an herbal tea," the network joked.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Executive producer Bernadette Caulfield also apologized in an interview with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.wnyc.org/story/behind-thrones-gots-executive-producer/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='WNYC&#39;s "All of It."' class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">WNYC's "All of It."</a> "We're sorry!" she said and added, "I guess if that’s the worst thing that they’re finding then we’re in good shape."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The cup was ultimately edited out of the episode by the next day.
