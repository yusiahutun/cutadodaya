An acoustic riff pins this mostly organic new offering from his upcoming <a href=#>Life Changes</a> album. "Unforgettable" is a breezy country train that picks up steam at each chorus before releasing a burst to begin a new verse. It's refreshing, and at barely two-and-a-half minutes, it leaves you wanting more.</p><p>With two songs shared from Rhett's third studio album, it's clear he's simply moving forward with the open-handed, inviting style that made him a country headliner. "Craving You" and "Unforgettable" are more advanced and maybe more mature songs&nbsp;that don't leave behind young audiences.</p><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong>:&nbsp;Rhett admits this song doesn't describe his relationship with wife Lauren, as they've known each other for too long. But the song does get Lauren's approval. It's worth noting that their wedding anniversary is Oct. 12, not far from the date mentioned in&nbsp;the opening verse of "Unforgettable."</p><p><strong>Listen to Thomas Rhett, "Unforgettable"</strong></p><p><strong>Thomas Rhett Tells the Story of "Unforgettable"</strong></p><h3>Thomas Rhett's "Unforgettable" Lyrics:</h3><p>It was the 14th of October / Had the T-shirt off your shoulder / I was drunk, said I was sober / And you said yeah right / We were talking for a minute / Then some guy tried to cut in / You took my hand and we pretended / Like I was your guy.</p><p>Oh then I tried to guess your middle name / For 30 minutes we played that game.</p><p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>That mango-rita you were drinkin’ / And that Coldplay song you were singin’ / And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’ / That it’s crazy I remember every detail but I do / From your blue jeans to your shoes / Girl that night was just like you / Unforgettable.</p><p>We were dancing, we were buzzing / Taking shots like it was nothing / Did the running man, you loved it / Yeah you laughed out loud / You brushed away your blonde hair / And you kissed me out of nowhere / I can still show you the spot / Where everything went down.</p><p>Oh I told you I was gonna marry you / You probably didn’t think that it was true.</p><p>Oh that night was just like you, baby / I can taste the mango-rita you were drinking / And it feels just like it was last weekend / Then we jumped in / Right off the deep end.</p><p>That mango-rita you were drinkin’ / And that Coldplay song you were singin’ / And I bet right now you’re probably thinkin’ / That it’s crazy I remember every detail but I do / I can still smell your perfume / Girl that night was just like you / Unforgettable.</p><p><strong>Now,&nbsp;the Top 10 Songs of 2017 (So Far)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmraCfoq60edGhnK2sXaq7p7vRoJytrJGXuaZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./43739.html><span>←</span><span>Andover, Kan., Launches 10,000-Capacity Amphitheater</span></a>
