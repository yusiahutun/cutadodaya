Javi Marroquin would be featured</a> in the upcoming season of Marriage Boot Camp, you may have been a little underwhelmed.</p><p>After all, we’ve known that things were over for them for well over a year now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It was late last year when their divorced was finalized — it’s not exactly a secret how things end up for them.</p><p>So why would the show bother to show us footage of a relationship that’s been dead for so long, especially when <a href=#>their breakup drama has already been so well-documented</a> on Teen Mom 2?</p><p>We’ll be honest, at first it sounded like a pretty poor choice.</p><p>But now we’re finally seeing some scenes between Kailyn and Javi …</p><p>And even though the downfall of their relationship is such old news, actually seeing everything go down is proving to be very, very interesting.</p><p>You can tell things are going to be good when, in their intro, Javi explains that "Right now we’re currently not together, but I am here to see if maybe that changes."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Then Kailyn adds "I came here with Javi with no intentions of getting back together."</p><p>Hey, at least she’s honest.</p><p>It does seem like she’s kind of on the fence though, because in another clip she says that she hopes that Marriage Boot Camp "can help us figure out how to solve our issues, because when I envision myself being married, I don’t think that I would have ever anticipated it being this troubled."</p><p>Then we cut to a clip of all the cast members together — Kailyn is asked if they’re married, and she laughs and says that they’re "on our way to being divorced!"</p><p>Javi explains that yes, they are married, but she stresses that the divorce "will be finalized, like, next week."</p><p>If you think this sounds almost too messy, then you’re thinking right.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>One of their biggest issues, according to Kailyn, is that Javi refuses to let go of her past mistakes.</p><p>For Javi though, one of their lowest points was when he was deployed and "I found out she was sleeping with someone else."</p><p>She tries to say that that’s not what happened, because "I don’t believe it’s cheating if you’re separated."</p><p>He hits back with "I believe it’s cheating when you don’t know you’re separated."</p><p>This touches on something we’ve heard before, which is that she believed the marriage was over before he ever left for his deployment, but <a href=#>he thought they were still working on things</a>.</p><p>In yet another clip, she tells him that her heart isn’t in the marriage anymore, that she just wants to be able to co-parent together and go their separate ways.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The doctors on the show are convinced that she’s lying, because if she wasn’t at least a little interested in repairing the relationship, she wouldn’t be there.</p><p>Because why else would she do the show? It’s not like she’s getting a nice paycheck and some more exposure or anything.</p><p>Javi tries to tell her that the kids deserve for them to give their marriage one last shot, but she argues that sometimes it’s best for a couple to split and be happy instead of staying in a miserable marriage just for the children.</p><p>It’s actually all very, very sad.</p><p>Will you be tuning in this season?!</p><p>Check out Kailyn and Javi’s drama for yourself in the video below:</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6voJ2dn6h8rK3IpbCnZZykxLPFjJqlnWWalsOqecyaqaunoaq2r3nFop6hrF2drrOwjKilZqWRp7%2BqrcaeZJunn6l6pK3MqWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-manually-select-which-ecobee3-sensor-to-use.html><span>←</span><span>How to Manually Select Which Ecobee Sensor to Use</span></a>
