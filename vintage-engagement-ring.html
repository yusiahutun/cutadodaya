"To me, it’s what makes it more romantic and special," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While those of us without access to a vault full of royal heirlooms will need to shop around for the perfect ring, this can still be a joyous experience. Here, industry insiders reveal their tips for sourcing an antique engagement ring that will make you want to say, ‘I do’.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Where should you look?</h2><ul data-node-id=11 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>Traditional antique jewellery markets like London’s Burlington Arcade and Hatton Garden remain great sources of inspiration. With plenty of sellers and makers in one place, you can wander from shop to shop gathering ideas as you go.</li><li>Auction houses are amazing places to unearth a vintage treasure. "We offer more than 40 sales a year, with a vast array of styles and eras under the same roof. There’s on-hand advice whenever you need it and you can try everything on," says Kate Flitcroft, a Senior Specialist at Bonhams' jewellery department. "You also get more bang for your buck. Unless you go for a hotly contested item, or something with a famous provenance which might push up its estimate, a ring bought at auction is typically half the price of what you would pay in a retail shop."</li><li>If you’re after a more bespoke experience, look to trusted independent antique dealers. "We can offer a really personalised service and often have more stock than we have on display or on social media, so can hunt down perfect options for you at every price point," says Hetty Stephen, who adds that Instagram can be a useful tool for checking out a seller’s wares.

If you’re going to an auction, check out everything online and in the catalogue first to help you narrow down the styles you like."</li><li>Be open minded. "Instagram offers endless window-shopping opportunities to help give you inspiration, but don’t be swayed by what you think you should buy, or any pre-conceptions of what an engagement ring should look like," says Henry Bailey.</li></ul><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What should you bear in mind whilst shopping?</h2><ul data-node-id=18 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>Checking condition is key. "Make sure the metal isn’t too worn and the stones aren’t chipped or scratched. Try giving the ring a gentle tap near your ear, too – a rattle means the stones are loose and the settings need adjusting," says Hetty Stephen.</li><li>If retaining value is important to you, "it’s worth checking that the whole ring is original or whether any adaptations have been made," suggests Henry Bailey. Make sure that any resizing can be done without losing hallmarks or marker's signatures from inside the ring band, as this can affect resale value, too.</li><li>At an auction, it’s helpful to keep a rough budget in mind and don’t forget about buyer’s premiums, which are added on to every sale. "That said, it can also pay to be flexible. Often, all that stands between you and your dream ring is one more bid," says Kate Flitcroft.</li><li>Remember that some antique rings won’t sit flush against a wedding band and might leave a gap on your finger. "If this is going to annoy you, you can always have a band made to fit – just ensure it’s the same metal purity, 18k gold for example, as your engagement ring so they are less likely to scratch each other," notes Hetty Stephen.</li></ul><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Life Lessons: Alicia Vikander" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/alicia-vikander-1657096105.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmS3psPEpaOeqqlixKLAwqGcrGeRaX15hZRqZ29npp67ta3GnmSeppeWtKa5xKerZqqZo7Rw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./expectations-and-their-impact-on-life.html><span>←</span><span>Expectations and their Impact on Life</span></a>
