"I just think that I would think about it too much. It would bother me in a way. I wouldn't be comfortable with it, and I don't know why.”</p><p>It's surprising that the founder of the <a href=#>"SlutWalk"</a> wouldn't be more open sexually since she's been extremely vocal in the past about her sexual fluidity.</p><p><strong>See photos: <a href=#>The Sexy Women of Amber Rose's SlutWalk 2016</a></strong></p><p>She once <a href=#>told Complex</a>: “I'm extremely open with my sexuality.

Wouldn't sleeping with two men simultaneously tap into the same insecurity she says she'd feel dating a bisexual man?</p><p>Things that make you go, “Hmmm…”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnh7j2pmamhfrLW6ecCmmZ6qXae8tLGMoqpmoqWowW66zq1kraCRqXqqutOoZJuho5rFtq3LZqSepl2kv27Ax6ucnquforK0edWim56nXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./405802-top-10-online-chat-games-play-friends-2021-html.html><span>←</span><span>Top 10 online chat games you should play with friends in 2021</span></a>
