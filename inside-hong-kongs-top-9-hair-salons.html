Enter the Kerasilk Keratin Treatment Service by Goldwell: it’s a type of Brazilian blowout treatment that ditches the chemicals in favor of all-natural keratin. Its special formula creates an extra keratin bond inside the structure of the hair strand (rather than just on the surface)—to smooth the hair from the inside out. It’s also one of the only smoothening treatments that are safe during pregnancy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The experience:</strong><br>South London stylist Ben has worked with my hair before, so knows how curly and unruly it can be, and so he recommended the extra-strength serum (there are two levels of intensity) all over. The balm is applied to wet hair for 15 minutes, before it’s washed and blown dry; and then for the laborious section: each strand of hair has to be gone over with straighteners at least six times to lock in the keratin. After another wash and blow dry you’ve got your glossy, straight-haired effect for up to six months. Let the team know if you’re in a hurry and two stylists can work on your hair—otherwise expect to be here for four hours. While away the time by letting former TV make-up artist Krystina overhaul your look: it takes about 40 minutes for a full makeover that definitely left me feeling camera ready.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The result:</strong><br>My curly hair used to take half an hour to blow-dry and straighten—plus extra time with the straighteners in between washes.

He’s friendly, charming and he knows his trade.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The experience:</strong><br>My hair is curly and unruly at the best of times (not to mention thinning at an alarming rate), and it's prone to mushrooming out at the sides for that vintage stupid-80s-teen-actor look. Daz understood my problems immediately and he suggested a solution that’s new to me: tapering the hair towards the top of the head, as opposed to sloping it towards the neck. That way, as is grows back, the hair won't billow to the sides in the same way. Seems straightforward now that you mention it, but no one's ever cut my hair that way before.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The result:</strong><br>Darren’s suggested cut worked amazingly well. It was a sharp, young summery look on the day, and even a few months on, my hair isn't mushrooming out nearly as badly as it has before.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Top tip:</strong><br>If you want to book with Darren himself then make sure to to check the website: he divides his time between his salons in Shanghai and Hong Kong, so he's always in demand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Men's cuts from $500; women's cuts from $880. 2/F, Tung Chai Building, 86-90 Wellington St., Central, 2956-3668, <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">www.dazhk.com</span></a>.</p><h3 type=h3 class="heading1 e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1" data-qa=Component-Component>9.

The modern, open space is flooded with light thanks to big floor-to-ceiling wraparound windows, which are especially great for admiring a new hair color. And The Firm does more than hair, too, with a dedicated area for mani-pedis, massages and waxing services. Thanks to removable salon stations, the space can also transform into a venue for parties or product launches.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The stylist:</strong><br>I brought in my go-to photo of Jessica Biel, and my stylist Sandy Ng immediately knew what to do. She tells me what I need: natural on top, with sunny streaks towards my ends—an effect that can be achieved with a balayage. That’s the “it” hair coloring technique of the moment, as natural roots mean easy maintenance.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The experience:</strong><br>Sandy used a vertical tin-foil strategy, so I had some metal dreadlocks for a spell. The whole process honestly took ages, but that's because there are so many steps—Sandy had to dye my roots an enhanced version of my natural color, fix my weird orangey mid-section leftover from a previous dye job, blonde-ify the ends in strategic areas and then tone the whole thing. In other words: it is a long haul, however the salon's homemade ginger lemon tea and Sandy's great chat helps it fly by. She finished by drying and straightening my hair, then cutting while it was dry so that she could see how the colors were falling.&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The result:</strong><br>As I usually wear my hair wavy and as voluminous as physically possible, I wasn't a fan of leaving the salon with stick-straight, though I did love the color. My bangs came out a little too blonde, but Sandy adjusted them as soon as I mentioned it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cuts from $650, color from $650. 1/F, Hilltop Plaza, 49 Hollywood Rd., Central, <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">www.thefirmhk.com</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZLWsecyanpqymaOycK3RraCcpJVkf3F%2FlmtnameZo8CqsMRmn6iml2K4sLrGrGStp6Bihm60wKKpZquRobyvvw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./apk-vs-app-bundle-why-is-google-changing-androids-app-format.html><span>←</span><span>APK vs App Bundle: Why Is Google Changing Android's App Format?</span></a>
