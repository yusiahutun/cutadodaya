The couple has been married for almost three decades and is the parents of two children.</p><p>It has been some time since Doricot’s husband Seger decided to end his performing career. Although Juanita was not the first person Bob walked down the aisle with, she proved to be “the one” for the retired psychedelic vocalist.</p><p>So how did the couple manage to turn a chance meeting into a blissful journey that has gone so smoothly? Find out, along with some facts about Bob Seger’s third wife, Juanita Dorricot.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Juanita Dorricott Is From Ohio</strong></h2><p>Juanita Dorricott&nbsp;was <a href=# rel=noopener>born</a> around 1964. She is also often called Nita.</p><p>The youngest of five children, Bob Seger’s wife with blue eyes and blonde hair was born in Kent, Ohio, but moved to Troy, Michigan at the age of 10.</p><p>Doricotta once told me that her siblings started living all over the country as adults and that every summer they all meet on Mackinac Island.</p><p>“I love coming from a big family and am glad that my kids are close to their cousins,”</p><p>said Bob’s wife of 28 years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Juanita Dorricott And Her Husband, Bob Seger Are Together Since 1990&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Doricotte married her husband Seger on 10 July 1993 in a small private circle at The Village Club in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Nita is 19 years younger than her vocalist husband.</p><p>Together they are the parents of a son Cole (born 1992) and a daughter Samantha Char (born 1995).</p><p>Juanita and the Detroit-born rock icon are said to have started dating in January 1991.</p><p>Seger dedicated one of his songs, “You Take Me In”, to his long-time partner Doricot, who only found out about it after the album’s release. In fact, the singer <a href=# rel=noopener>admitted</a> that he kept it a secret from her for three years. Another song he dedicated to his wife is “You Take Me In”. In addition, “Are You” was inspired by an incident when Nita bought children’s shoes on the internet.</p><p>The blonde mother of two and her husband divide their time between Orchard Lake Village and West Bloomfield, Michigan. They used to live in Oakland County, Mich.</p><p>Prior to Doricot, Seger was married to Rene Andriette. They were married in 1968, but the union lasted “one day less than a year”. Juanita’s husband then had a long relationship with Jan Dinsdale from 1972 to 1983. He then married the actress Annette Sinclair in 1987, but the two divorced a year later.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Kaylee Stoermer Coleman?

However, she could remember Bob telling her a joke about country singers.</p><p>Juanita eventually called off the engagement, and Bob threw himself into it to make a move. After a while, they became friends, fell in love, and quickly moved on – soon to celebrate their 29th wedding anniversary.</p><p>Nita said she still has the napkin with her phone number written on it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Brief About Juanita Dorricot’s Rockstar Husband, Bob Seger</strong></h2><p>As already mentioned, Dorricot’s long-time singing partner Seger is a hard rock vocalist who achieved his greatest national success with Live Bullet (1976), a multi-platinum album.
