It’s always a deeply moving experience to sing and play his songs.”</p><p>“Few musicians have had as profound an impact on music as Kris Kristofferson,” adds Keith Wortman, creator and executive producer of the show. “It’s only fitting that we celebrate his artistry just blocks from where the legend was born with both his friends and contemporaries and those who are continuing his legacy with raw, honest songwriting of their own.”</p><p>Recently, a block of tickets has become available for those interested in attending the concert. Ticket start at $75 and are on sale at Ticketmaster.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpKqZqHqsvsisq6ielpq%2FtLvNZquroZKqwaZ5wqilnJ2iqXqxsdGfpqullafAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sharp-objects-episode-7-falling-recap-review.html><span>←</span><span>Sharp Objects Episode 7 Recap</span></a>
