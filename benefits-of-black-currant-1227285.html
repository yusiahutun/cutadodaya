These humble, juicy fruits are highly nutritious, and you must know the best <strong>benefits of black currants</strong><strong> </strong>to keep yourself in good health. The humble fruit shares broad culinary and medicinal uses. Whether you are looking for a tart and flavorful ingredient to prepare jams for kids at home or looking for a natural remedy to relieve inflammation, these blue-black berries can help. Also, the active ingredients in nutritious berries may improve cognitive functions, which not only helps you stay fit but improve your quality of life as well. Mary Sabat, our contributor and a certified nutritionist states that berries, such as blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries, are rich in compounds like flavonoids and anthocyanins that have been linked to improved cognitive function. These compounds possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that can protect brain cells from damage caused by oxidative stress and inflammation. Additionally, the consumption of berries has been associated with enhanced communication between brain cells, increased neural plasticity, and improved blood flow to the brain, all of which contribute to better cognitive performance and a potentially lower risk of age-related cognitive decline. Here, we are highlighting a few impressive health benefits of black currant to inspire you to include these healthy fruits in your diet and enjoy the best of your physical and mental health.

Apart from their flavor and soothing aroma, they are known for their high nutritional profile. These berries come packed with vital nutrients such as antioxidants, vitamin C, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, and many others.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=659543f061b51><strong>Nutritional Value of Currants</strong></h2><p>According to the U.S Department of Agriculture (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Health Benefits of Black Currant: Nutrition & How to Use ","1227285","https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/173964/nutrients","articlepage","/health/nutrition/benefits-of-black-currant-1227285","1","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>1</u></a>), a 100-gram serving of currants contain the following nutrients:</p><ul><li>Energy: 56 kcal</li><li>Magnesium: 13 mg</li><li>Phosphorus: 44 mg</li><li>Potassium: 275 mg</li><li>Sodium: 1 mg</li><li>Folate: 8 µg</li><li>Carbohydrate: 13.8 g</li><li>Fiber: 4.3 g</li><li>Sugars: 7.37 g</li><li>Calcium: 33 mg</li><li>Iron: 1 mg</li><li>Fat: 0.2 g</li><li>Protein: 1.4 g</li><li>Vitamin C: 41 mg</li><li>Vitamin A: 42 IU</li><li>Vitamin K: 11 µg</li><li>Folate: 8µg</li><li>Choline: 7.6 mg</li></ul><h2 id=659543f061b58><strong>Health Benefits of Eating Black Currant Regularly</strong></h2><p>Just like their versatile culinary use, these tart berries offer a range of health benefits right from relieving inflammation and boosting immunity to lowering the risk of life-threatening disorders.

May Help Lower the Risk of Kidney Problems</strong></h3><p>The presence of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds in black currant makes them a superfood for kidneys. These active compounds may help lower the risk of chronic kidney problems and infections. Our contributor Mary Sabat states, “Antioxidants play a crucial role in boosting kidney health by neutralizing harmful molecules called free radicals, which can damage cells and contribute to kidney dysfunction. These molecules are produced naturally in the body and can accumulate due to factors like poor diet and environmental stressors. Antioxidants, abundant in foods like colorful fruits and vegetables, help prevent oxidative stress on the kidneys, thereby reducing the risk of inflammation and preserving overall renal function.”</p><p>Also, consuming whole fruit or extracts of fruit may help prevent the formation of kidney stones (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Health Benefits of Black Currant: Nutrition & How to Use ","1227285","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12373623/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/benefits-of-black-currant-1227285","2","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>2</u></a>). Drinking blackcurrant juice or tea uplifts your urine’s natural pH and makes it more alkaline. Along with this, the healthy compounds in the tart berries, help eliminate excess amounts of citric and oxalic acid from the body, thus reducing the risk of kidney stone formation.</p><h3 id=659543f061b65><strong>2. Boasts Cardio-protective Properties</strong></h3><p>Higher levels of unhealthy fats or bad cholesterol in the body uplifts your risk of suffering cardiac health problems along with weak liver and metabolic health. As per clinical journals, eating a diet rich in anthocyanins can help improve the levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) or good cholesterol and improve heart health (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Health Benefits of Black Currant: Nutrition & How to Use ","1227285","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3042791/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/benefits-of-black-currant-1227285","3","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>3</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Blackcurrants come packed with a high concentration of antioxidants which prevent the oxidation of fats in the body and lower the risk of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular ailments (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Health Benefits of Black Currant: Nutrition & How to Use ","1227285","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21776460/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/benefits-of-black-currant-1227285","4","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>4</u></a>).</p><h3 id=659543f061b69><strong>3.

The powerful plant compounds in blackcurrants help improve the blood flow in optic nerves. It is found that regular consumption of foods rich in anthocyanins may lower the risk of suffering vision loss in patients with a history of glaucoma. Also, the healthful nutrients in blackcurrant also help improve eye health in patients suffering from diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal arterial occlusion (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Health Benefits of Black Currant: Nutrition & How to Use ","1227285","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3669603/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/benefits-of-black-currant-1227285","7","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>7</u></a>).

Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol leads to the formation of free radicals in the body, which react with phospholipids and eventually cause inflammation. The active polyphenols in blackcurrants help protect the healthy fats and proteins in the body from the ill effects of free radicals (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Health Benefits of Black Currant: Nutrition & How to Use ","1227285","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5968245/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/benefits-of-black-currant-1227285","11","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>11</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>According to Dr. Allen Conrad, Doctor of Chiropractic and Owner of Montgomery County Chiropractic Center, “Blackcurrants contain anthocyanins.

Deep moisturization of the skin makes a perfect solution to prevent such issues. Though there are several medicated products available for the management of such problems, eating blackcurrant makes a natural remedy to deeply hydrate and nourish the skin cells naturally.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>The active polysaccharides in these tart berries keep a check on the production of inflammation-causing compounds and may help prevent skin problems (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Health Benefits of Black Currant: Nutrition & How to Use ","1227285","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5787412/","articlepage","/health/nutrition/benefits-of-black-currant-1227285","14","Body_Hyperlink","health","nutrition")'><u>14</u></a>).
