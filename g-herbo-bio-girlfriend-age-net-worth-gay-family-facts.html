G Herbo, born Herbert Wright III, is one of these artists who rolled off the production line in 2014.</p><p>He has released numerous projects since he came on the scene, and it doesn’t look like he’s going to slow down anytime soon. The discography of this rapper includes albums such as Welcome to Fazoland, 2014; Strictly 4 My Fans, 2016; and Humble Beast, 2017.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>G Herbo’s Bio, Age<br></strong></h2><p>Herbert Wright III was born on October 8, 1995, in South Shore on the southeast side of Chicago. His city was popularly known as “Terror Town” because of the frequent gang activities taking place there. He grew up with artists like Jadakiss, Lil Wayne, Gucci Mane, Young Jeezy, and Chief Keef. He and his fellow rapper and girlfriend Lil Bibby later began their rap careers after being inspired by their rap heroes.</p><p>Both Herbo and Lil Bibby belong to the brotherhood of N.L.M.B. The name draws from various sources of inspiration. The four letters N, L, M, and B come from a fusion of two gang names: No Limit (a faction of the gang of Almighty Black P. Stone) and Muskegon Boyz (a faction of the Gangster Disciples). However, the initials N.L.M.B. also mean “Never Leave My Brothers” for Herbo’s N.L.M.B. Brotherhood.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Bill Skarsgard Biography, Siblings, Girlfriend and Family Life</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Songs and Mixtapes</strong></h2><p>G Herbo and Lil Bibby got some well-deserved attention for their song Kill Shit. Since then, the song has received over 15 million hits and counts on YouTube. Even the famous Canadian presenter Drake has called it the future. In February 2014 Lil Herb dropped Return to Fazoland, his first mixtape dedicated to his friend Fazon Robinson. He was the earliest of Herb’s friends to lose his life to gun violence. The project received many positive reviews, with the magazine Fader praising Herb’s rich content and lyrical dexterity.</p><p>Herb then reported on the songs of top shots such as Nicki Minaj, Common, and Chance The Rapper. In the same year, XXL magazine chose him for its Show & Prove segment of the 2014 issue of Freshmen Class. He also surprised his fan community with the release of an unexpected second mixtape for 2014, entitled Pistol P Project.</p><p>2015 was a really big year for the rapper when he kicked it off with a feature on Chief Keef’s remix of Faneto. His fellow rappers King Louie and his long-time girlfriend Lil Bibby were also involved. Lil Herb proved to be something of a marketing genius when he was not accepted into the XXL Freshmen Class of 2015. Instead of reacting with a burst, as most rappers do, he released a single called XXL. The magazine praised the rapper and praised the song. As a result, he was included in the Freshmen List of 2016.</p><p>In August 2015, Herb announced his third mixtape, entitled Ballin Like I’m Kobe, which was released in honor of his friend Jacobi Herring. In September of the same year, he signed with the Cinematic Music Group and officially changed his stage name to G Herbo. Ballin Like I’m Kobe was released on September 29th under the title Cinematic and received much critical acclaim and positive reviews.</p><p>He rounded out the year with a single entitled Lord Knows, on which he worked with New York rapper Joey Bada$$.</p><p>On April 4 of the following year, G. Herbo sat down with SXSW, where he announced the title of his debut album. In March he released a single entitled Yeah I Know. In the middle of the year, he released two singles for the album entitled Pull Up and Drop. On October 10th he released the music video for a fourth single. He also sang a song with DJ Twin, They Know Us with Lil Bibby and Sean Kingston.</p><p>In the time since the announcement of his debut album Humble Beast, G. Herbo released a fourth mixtape, Strictly 4 My Fans, and an updated version of his debut mixtape Welcome to Fazoland 1.5, and he has also released the singles I Know, Red Snow, I Like, Everything and 4 Minutes of Hell, Pt.5.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>G Herbo, Girlfriend, Gay Rumors, Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Herb has been with Ariana Fletcher since 2014. Ariana, who has been lovesick before, says she feels comfortable and at peace with Herb until she recently posted a message on Instagram that she is now single and no longer romantically attached to G. Herbo. There were no specific reasons for the breakup, but the nature of the message suggests infidelity.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Grayson Allen Height, Parents, Girlfriend, Family, Bio</a></strong></p><p>She is the same age as the rapper and owns her own business called Kyche Extensions, a name she coined from the names of her late brother Kyle and her nephew.</p><p>The rapper has not shown any gay tendencies. However, Ariana went out with a girl from her high school days when she was just 14. On November 19, 2017, Ariana announced on her Instagram that she was carrying Herb’s child. Apparently, he was so excited by the news that he gave her a sexy black Range Rover.</p><p>G. Herbo still has a lot to give to the music industry as he is still in the infancy of his career. He is estimated at 1 to 2 million dollars.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>G Herbo Family, Facts</strong></h2><p>There is not much to know about family history or scandalous news about G. Herbo. Apart from his closest friend Lil Bibby, his friends to whom he has dedicated two of his albums, and his girlfriend Ariana, there is not much more to know about him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ktG60xKuZqGWSnrxus8iro5%2BqmZq7pXnAoJxmppWperi70a2fZp%2BRrnqnrcyio7Jllpawtb%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./flybarre-kicked-my-ass-i-liked-it.html><span>←</span><span>FlyBarre Kicked My Ass And I Liked It</span></a>
