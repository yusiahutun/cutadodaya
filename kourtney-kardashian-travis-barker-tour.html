He was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles after seeking care at West Hills Hospital. On July 2, 2022, Travis posted an update on his Instagram stories about <a class=link href=# rel=noopener data-ylk="slk:why he was hospitalized" data-rapid_p=21 data-v9y=1>why he was hospitalized</a>. “I went in for an endoscopy Monday feeling great. But, after dinner, I developed excruciating pain and have been hospitalized ever since,” he wrote. “During the endoscopy, I had a very small polyp removed right in a very sensitive area, usually handled by specialists, which unfortunately damaged a critical pancreatic drainage tube. This resulted in severe, life-threatening pancreatitis. I am so very, very grateful that with intensive treatment I am currently much better.”</p><p>Kourtney also posted her own updates on her Instagram story on July 2, 2022. “Oh what a scary and emotional week it has been. Our health is everything and sometimes we take for granted how quickly it can change. Travis and I went in for a routine endoscopy together and he ended up with severe, life-threatening pancreatitis.” She continued, “I am so grateful to God for healing my husband, for all of your prayers for him and for us, for the overwhelming outpouring of love and support. I am so touched and appreciative. I am so so thankful to our specialists, doctors and nurses at Cedars Sinai for taking such wonderful care of my husband and me during the stay.”</p><p>Travis’ hospitalization came weeks after his <a href=# rel=noopener>third wedding</a>&nbsp;to Kourtney in Portofino, Italy. They had their first wedding in Las Vegas on April 3, 2022, after Travis performed at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony. The couple did not have a wedding license but instead had an&nbsp;<a href=#>unofficial wedding</a>&nbsp;with an Elvis impersonator. They later got officially married in a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>courthouse</a>&nbsp;in Santa Barbara, CA on May 15, 2022, before their dream wedding in Portofino, Italy on May 22, 2022. All of Kourtney and Travis’ family and kids attended the wedding abroad.</p><p><a href=# id=auto-tag_the-kardashians data-tag=the-kardashians>The Kardashians</a>&nbsp;is available to stream on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>Hulu</a>.

You may think you know the Kardashians, but as Kris explains in her book, what’s in the media and in Keeping Up With the Kardashians is only the tip of the iceberg. In Kris Jenner…And All Things Kardashians, Kris reveals how she balanced six children (not to mention four stepchildren and numerous grandchildren) while building a business for her family. The book also dives into Kris’ relationship with Nicole Brown Simpson before and after her husband, O.J. Simpson, was accused of her murder.
