<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>4 Zodiac Signs Most Affected</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The full moon can bring revelations and rewards, but no natter what, it’s always a moment of change. Every 28 days, it brings deep-seated information to the surface, showing us what needs to be known in order to grow. And if you’re one of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>zodiac signs most affected by the full moon</a>, you should prepare for an earth-shattering realization that pushes you out of your comfort zone.</p><p>A full moon is not just when the moon is at its biggest and brightest, but also when it’s at its most powerful and contradictory. This is when the moon—ruler of your internal self—forms an opposition with the sun—ruler of your external self—creating inner conflict that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>forces you to take action</a> one way or another. Known for evoking plenty of shocking twists and unexpected turns, a full moon dives deep into your psyche and shows you what you already know, but were previously unaware of. It sets you free from repressed anger and confusing emotions, clearing away space for enough clarity to guide you forward.</p><p>On February 24, a <a href=#>full moon in Virgo</a> will reach its peak at exactly 7:30 a.m. ET. Leo—the mutable earth sign of logic, intellect, service, health, data, detail, analysis, healing, charity, and problem-solving—is urging us to confront what’s on our minds and what lies in our hearts. It’s time to face the truth of your reality and rediscover how you can improve it. Opposing the sun in dreamy, spiritual, otherworldly, empathetic, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">highly emotional Pisces</a>, this full moon wants you to find balance between fact and fiction, as well as the impulse to be rational and the desire to believe in fantasies. At its core, the Virgo-Pisces axis is about the soul vs the human body, and the heart vs the head. While Virgo wants to rely on tangible, obvious truths, Pisces is more concerned with what has yet to be proven. However, Virgo’s obsession with logic can be just as illogical as Pisces’ obsession with something higher than ourselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-List-Redirect-Design-26.png><p>Because Virgo is so obsessed with finding solutions, you might be surprised to find that this full moon produces more questions than it does answers. This full moon is both ruled by and opposing Mercury—<a href=#>planet of communication and </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>cognitive</a><a href=#> function</a>—which happens to be moving through Pisces, the zodiac sign of its detriment. When Mercury is moving through Pisces, calculations can produce inaccurate results and emotional thinking can cause you to veer off a common sense path. However, Mercury in Pisces is an important time for realizing that the most important questions to ask rarely ever have clear-cut answers. And as this full moon forms a trine <a href=#>with </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Jupiter</a><a href=#> in Taurus</a>, you may discover that answers can be disappointing, but asking more questions can lead to further discoveries.</p><p>However, this full moon is also opposing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Saturn—planet of restriction and inhibition</a>—which could clog your emotional drain pipes. While most full moons produce a clear and cathartic release, this one may force you to push harder to understand how you feel. Don’t be surprised if your emotions feel cold or repressive, because Saturn is laying the lid on your desire to unleash your heart. What’s standing in your way may be exactly what needs healing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=these-4-zodiac-signs-will-feel-the-full-moon-most>These 4 Zodiac Signs Will Feel the Full Moon Most</h2><p>If your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sun sign</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>moon sign</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rising sign</a> falls under any of the following the upcoming full moon will bring you to the end of a journey, leaving you with revelations and rewards. Here’s why these zodiac signs will feel particularly rocked by it:</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.9278252611586><h2>Gemini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zodiacbannerday_gemini.png><p>It’s time to look at the parts of your life that feel private and worth protecting from prying eyes, Gemini. This full moon is showing you deeper truths regarding your home and family dynamics, as well as your relationship with your ancestral roots. Are resentments with family members ready to be resolved? Is something about your home life preventing you from feeling truly welcomed? Are memories of your early childhood striking chords of feeling and healing? In order to blossom, you must regularly water your roots and nourish your personal life from the ground-up. We are often asked to sacrifice home for work, but there is no success without the heart. No accolades or public recognition will matter—or truly last—without something solid and sentimental to hold it all in place. Home can mean a million different things, so do not allow someone else to define if for you. Let this full moon be the moment you take back the keys to your front door. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.8609332113449><h2>Virgo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zodiacbannerday_virgo.png><p>Something big is about to unfold, and without a doubt, it’s Virgos who are the main characters of this story. Something important in your life is coming to fruition, whether it’s an evolution of your personality or an epiphany about regarding all the ways you’ve grown, evolved, and returned to your comfort zones along the way. With the full moon rising in your first house of the self, you’re discovering that you have the power to be your own hero and it all comes down to your ability to believe that you can save yourself. The person you’ve always been waiting for—whether it’s a parent who finally steps up, a lover that finally loves you properly, or a friend who will always be there for you—has always been inside of you. And during this full moon, you’re being encouraged to stop searching for something else to complete you and to recognize all the ways you can complete yourself. There is nothing and no one to wait for when you already have the qualities you admire most. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.3506550218341><h2>Sagittarius</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zodiacbannerday_sagittarius.png><p>You’re coming to terms with success or recognition in your career, Sagittarius. Whether you’re finally receiving the accolades you deserve or you’re realizing that it’s time to move on from a dead-end job, this full moon is leading you toward professional liberation. Taking place in your 10th house of public image and career pursuits, this full moon is making damn sure that your name is in the right people’s mouths. If you’re receiving a promotion, it may be time to negotiate the terms, and if you’re leaving one career path in favor of another, have faith that your future is bright. This full moon brings your attention to what type of success really matters to you and how you should market yourself. If you want to be seen a certain way, don’t linger in the shadows. If you’ve feel uninspired by your work, this full moon may reignite your motivation to achieve what you’ve always wanted to achieve. Your superiors are there to lead you, not discourage you, so make sure you’re putting your faith in the right people. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.3448275862069><h2>Pisces</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/zodiacbannerday_pisces.png><p>A partnership works when two people come together and agree on a set of terms, Pisces. As much as you may want a certain relationship to work out, keep in mind that you can’t control what another person says, does, or thinks. This full moon rises in your seventh house of partnerships, forcing you to become aware of someone else’s actions and intentions (and what their influence on your life says about you). This full moon could bring a new person into the foray or show you the way a relationship has evolved. You might discover a new enemy, a new ally, or that someone that contains qualities of both. If passion or conflict has been intensifying, this full moon could cause emotions to pop off, forcing you to find a solution or part ways for good. Your seventh house is also a mirror, showing you what parts of yourself you feel you lack and why you choose to be with someone else in order to fill those voids. Is it possible that the void you’re trying to fill was never there in the first place? <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here.</a></p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfr7yltcCcZKyhl6PAbrnOrKtmmZabsqTAxJ1kn62coXquu86nZJ%2BdkqfCor7YZmlpamRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-did-angelina-jolie-rent-luxury-apartment-korean.html><span>←</span><span>Why did Angelina Jolie rent a luxury apartment in Korean capital Seoul?</span></a>
