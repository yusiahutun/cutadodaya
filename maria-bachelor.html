Someone to do life with,” Joey told host Jesse Palmer during the “After the Final Rose” special.</p><p>In an interview with<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://bachelornation.com/2024/01/19/exclusive-joey-graziadei-reveals-if-he-has-any-bachelor-regrets-and-why-he-trusts-he-ll-find-his-wife/> BachelorNation.com</a> in January 2024, Joey revealed whether he had any regrets about his season as the Bachelor. “I’m not really a person to have regrets. What I tried to do the whole time and what I continue to try to do is be myself and lead with what I think is the best decision,” he said. “We all make mistakes and I’m not going to look back on anything and say that was something I regret. I think that I did this to the best of my ability. I know that, so I can’t really live with any regrets with that being the case.”</p><p>As for why he wanted to become the Bachelor, Joey told the website that he realized the process worked after he almost found The One with Charity. “It’s the fact that I’ve been through it and I know what the show can bring out,” he said. “One of the beautiful parts of it is that you are pushed to be your best self. You are in an uncomfortable situation, but how you deal with that says a lot about a person. It creates an atmosphere and environment that I believe in. I think it’s a great way to get to know someone.”</p><p>He continued, “Sometimes in dating, it takes a while to learn about someone to really figure out if you are compatible. There is often a lot of fluff in the beginning and you don’t have time for that in this and I think it makes it more real. You get to know someone to their core very quickly and that’s a really important thing for a healthy relationship.”</p><p>But back to Maria from The Bachelor 2024.
