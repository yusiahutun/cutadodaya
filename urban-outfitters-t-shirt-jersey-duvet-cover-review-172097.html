From sheets that sounded too good to be true (and were!) to comforters that fell apart after one wash, I’ve struggled to find linens that meet my three must-have criteria of being durable, comfortable, and (reasonably!) affordable.&nbsp;</p><p>Quality is also paramount: After all, we spend a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">third of our lives in bed</a>, so we should be sleeping on the best of the best, no? Enter <strong>Urban Outfitters’ T-Shirt Jersey Duvet Cover (</strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>$99-$149, Urban Outfitters</strong></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Miraculously, after my recent bad string of luck in the comforter department, I found an exceptionally cozy insert and subsequently set off on a hunt for the best duvet cover money could buy. I wanted something soft and cushy, but also something that I could use year-round.&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, I considered something with a more familiar fabric, but was persuaded to give the jersey duvet a go after a friend of mine raved about the company’s pillowcases <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">($24, Urban Outfitters)</a>, saying they were the <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">softest </a>ones she had ever purchased. So, I went online, clicked “add to cart,” and never looked back.&nbsp;</p><p>Made from 100 percent cotton, this duvet cover was crafted to feel just like your favorite worn-in t-shirt — incredibly soft and lightweight, with just a little bit of stretch — and trust me when I say, they nailed it. In fact, it just might be the softest set of bed linens I have ever felt in my life!&nbsp;</p><p>More than that, however, it’s also breathable. With this purchase, I’ve found find I stay cool in the summer and warm in the winter.&nbsp;</p><p>From a structural standpoint, it stays in place, thanks to the four interior ties it’s equipped with to secure your insert. There’s also a button closure to keep it from moving around.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s also plenty visually appealing. Available in seven hues and most bedding sizes from twin to king, it was extremely easy to customize to my taste.&nbsp;</p><p>Add in the fact that it fits in the wash (yes, it’s machine washable, too!), and I’ve become a fan for life.&nbsp;</p><p>But don’t just take it from me: This duvet cover is hit with most customers.&nbsp;</p><p>“This is one of the comfiest duvet covers that I have ever owned. The t-shirt material is so soft I never want to get out of my bed!” said buyer Haylee.&nbsp;</p><p>Another remarked, “I am always hesitant to buy bedding online because it’s so hard to determine what it will be like in person, but I am SO happy I made this purchase! The other reviews were right — It’s so soft, lightweight, and doesn’t wrinkle. I got the white one, I’m a little nervous about keeping it clean, but it’s perfect for a simple and cozy bedroom look. You won’t be disappointed!”</p><p>With the T-Shirt Jersey Duvet Cover, I’ve finally found the bedding of my dreams. Long gone are the days of tediously buying and testing comforter after comforter in the search of the perfect fit — I’ve already got it!</p><p>Now, if only I could get my hands on a matching sheet set …&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Where to buy:</strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong> $99-$149, Urban Outfitters</strong></a></p><p>See more of our <a href=#><strong>best product recommendations</strong></a>.
