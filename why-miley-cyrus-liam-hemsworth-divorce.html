Their marriage was complicated. On Wednesday, December 2, 2020, the “<a href=#>Midnight Sky</a>” singer opened up about her career and love life for an episode of The Howard Stern Show. Cyrus, who released her seventh studio album <a href=#>Plastic Hearts</a> the prior week, told host Howard Stern that her 10-year <a href=#>relationship with Hemsworth</a> ended simply because “there was too much conflict,” and that their divorce in 2019 had nothing to do with her sobriety. “When I come home, I want to be anchored by someone,” she explained. “I don’t get off on drama or fighting.”</p><p>“Me being an intense person and not wanting to sit with it and not wanting to go, you know, ‘What could be purposeful about this?’ I just clung to what I had left of that house, which was me and him,” she told Stern. “And I really do and did love him very, very, very much and still do, always will.”</p><p>She also revealed to Stern that she didn’t know that it was a possibility to get married to Hemsworth.” We were together since 16,” she said.&nbsp; “Our house burned down. We had been like, engaged—I don’t know if we really ever thought we were actually going to get married, but when we lost our house in Malibu—which if you listen to my voice pre- and post-fire, they’re very different so that trauma really affected my voice. And I was actually in South Africa, so I couldn’t come home, and like, my animals were tied to a post at the beach. I lost everything.”</p><p>At the time, a source told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> that Hemsworth wasn’t bothered by Miley’s Howard Stern interview about him and is focused on his relationship with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">model, Gabriella Brooks.</a>&nbsp;“Liam Hemsworth isn’t upset by the recent interview Miley did where she says there was too much conflict in their marriage. Liam was very hurt when they initially broke up, but he has moved on now and is happy with Gabriella,” the source said. “He’s very traditional and Gabriella shares the same values as him and gets along with his family. Their relationship is easygoing and they have similar upbringings and backgrounds.”</p><p>Cyrus and Hemsworth married in 2018 and announced their split less than a year later in 2019. The former couple met on the set of Nicholas Sparks’s The Last Song and had a tumultuous on-and-off relationship. They were engaged in 2012 but called it off and broke up until they got re-engaged in 2017. In a 2009 interview with Seventeen,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Cyrus talked about her first audition with Hemsworth</a>&nbsp;and how she was turned off by his attitude. It wasn’t until later, when she get to know him, that she fell for him.</p><p>“I heard a rumor that he didn’t really want the role,” Cyrus said. “And when he came in to audition for the role, I’m thinking, ‘Here’s this guy, he’s amazingly good-looking, super confident and he doesn’t realize how blessed he is to be in this room, because I know how blessed I am. This is such a big opportunity for both of us. And I was thinking, ‘Ugh, gross.’ You know?”</p><p>The couple definitely had their ups and downs—including a pretty disastrous experience in late 2018, when California wildfires wiped out their home in Malibu. Cyrus told Stern that she and the 30-year-old Hunger Games star “lost everything.”</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-3=processed>In an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Rolling Stone</a> in 2020, she revealed that the Malibu house fire “did what I couldn’t do myself”. “It removed me from what no longer was serving its purpose,” she told the magazine. “And then as you drown, you reach for that lifesaver and you want to save yourself. I think that’s really what, ultimately, getting married was for me. One last attempt to save myself.”</p><p>In September 2020, Cyrus clapped back at rumors about what caused her divorce from Hemsworth. “I recently just went through a very public divorce that f—ing sucked,” she said on an episode of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. “What really sucked about it wasn’t the fact that me and someone that I loved realize that we don’t love each other the way that we used to anymore. That’s OK. I can accept that.”</p><p>She continued, “I can’t accept the villainizing and all of those stories,” going on to reference the media’s perception that she moved on quickly with friend Kaitlynn Carter, and later, ex-boyfriend Cody Simpson.</p><p>A source told Us Weekly on Saturday, August 15, 2019 that the&nbsp;Hunger Games&nbsp;star l<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">eaned on his family</a>, including brothers Chris Hemsworth and Luke Hemsworth, after his split from the former Disney Channel star. “[He] has had the support of his family to help him move on,” the insider said. “Liam has been trying to be as private as possible and respectful about their relationship and breakup, and it’s a shame to him and his family that certain aspects about his and Miley’s relationship have been made public. He’s a very traditional and good guy and was very hurt by the way specific instances played out in front of the world.”</p><p>During her headlining set at Lollapalooza Brazil, she commented about her marriage when a couple proposed. “Yasss!” she screamed to the happy couple once the proposal was accepted. “Forever bitch, yasss! Congratulations! Honey, I hope your marriage goes better than mine. Mine was a f–king disaster.”</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
