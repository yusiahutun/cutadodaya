She’s also been in the ICU for more than a week now, her family added.</p><p>She wrote: “My amazing mom, Mary Lou, has a very rare form of pneumonia and is fighting for her life.</p><p>“She is not able to breathe on her own. She’s been in the ICU for over a week now. Out of respect for her and her privacy, I will not disclose all details. However, I will disclose that she is not insured.</p><p>Kelley added: “We ask that if you could help in any way, that 1) you PRAY! and 2) if you could help us with finances for the hospital bill. ANYTHING, absolutely anything, would be so helpful for my family and my mom. Thank y’all so very much!”</p><p>No other details about the 55-year-old’s <a href=#>health</a> were given, or what hospital she is currently at.</p><p>A fundraiser set up to help the family had an initial goal of raising $50,000. However, it’s already amassed more than $175k in a short space of time. Thousands of comments are sending their well-wishes and prayers to the Olympian.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-incredible-performance-at-the-olympics>Incredible performance at the Olympics</h2><p>Mary Lou Retton competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in LA, where she bagged the gold medal for the all-round. In the final rotation of the grueling competition, she was merely five-hundredths of a point behind rival Ecaterina Szabo from Romania. She would need a perfect 10 to win the final beat – which she achieved.</p><p>Retton was also the first American woman to win gold in that event. She held the title for 30 years, until Carly Patterson became the second woman in 2004.</p><p>The athlete also went home with two silver medals for team and vault, and two bronze medals for uneven bars and floor exercises.</p><p>Her incredible feats were celebrated on her home turf, with her being featured on the cover of the Wheaties box. She also graced Sports Illustrated that year, being named ‘Sportswoman of the Year’.</p><p>Retiring from the Olympics in 1986, she was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1997.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dancing-with-the-stars-and-special-tv-appearances>Dancing with the Stars and special TV appearances</h2><p>She didn’t stop there, Mary Lou Retton competed on Dancing with the Stars for season 27. She partnered up with Sasha Farber and lasted until the sixth week.</p><p>After hearing the news, Sasha has spoken out over Mary’s health crisis.</p><p>They remained friends for years after pairing up for the show.</p><p>“She was in LA [a few weeks] ago and she wanted to meet up, [but] I had rehearsals and I couldn’t,” Farber <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> Entertainment Tonight.</p><p>“She was like, ‘Let me take you out for dinner,’ and I couldn’t go because I had rehearsals.”</p><p>“But I just mean, you know, you’ve got to see the people [you care about], you’ve gotta say hi, you gotta call them,” he said. “And I’ve been speaking to her today.”</p><p>She also bagged roles in some <a href=#>movies</a> and TV shows, including musical hit Glee.</p><p>Retton has four daughters, Shayla, Skyla, Emma and McKenna, who she shares with ex-husband Shannon.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2Z%2BcLvLsqSpoZGjeqK6w2arr2Wjqa6zecWinqGsmaO0brLOq2StoJWev264yJ%2BcZqGeYrakwYyaqmackaq0qcDEq2SmmZuawG7B0aCcp6xdpbmmrY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./660c2a2f46163fd0588b45a2-html.html><span>←</span><span>Feria del Caballo 2024: horarios y quin estar hoy en Palenque de Texcoco, martes 2 de abril</span></a>
