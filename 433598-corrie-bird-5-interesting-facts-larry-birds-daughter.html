Before Janet gave birth, Larry denied having sired with her and refused to take up any parental responsibility.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/32406cce4f5097e5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Michele Carey biography: The life and times of the El Dorado star</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Janet tried getting him to send money for upkeep, but he denied it vehemently. It is then that the court ordered a paternity test which proved that he was a match. Below are a few interesting facts about this <a href=#>celebrity</a> daughter.</p><h3>1. Corrie Bird is married to Trent Theopolis Batson</h3><p class=align-left>The problematic marriage of her parents didn’t deter Corrie from pursuing a marriage of her own. On 17th May 2008, Corrie married her long-time lover, Trent Theopolis Batson and adopted his third name. Their marriage ceremony took place in a beautiful white chapel at the Rose Hulman Institute of Technology.</p><p class=align-left>The two do not have social media accounts and hardly take interviews. Trent was married before meeting Corrie. As of today, this couple has been together for 12 years and counting.</p><h3>2. Corrie adopted kids from her husband's previous union</h3><p class=align-left>Trent Baton was married before he met Corrie. He had two children, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Santana and Christian</a>, from his last marriage. On 18th June 2012, Trent and Corrie welcomed their first child Violet Marie Batson, at the Indiana University hospital.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1e6dd275c55bf3df.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bob Barker from The Price Is Right: net worth, wife, children, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Five years later, on 20th April 2017, Corrie and Trent were once again blessed with a son they named Sebastian Grey Smith. Trent has custody of his first two children, making them a <a href=#>family</a> of six.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b786df4451649b89.jpg><h3>3. Her parents had a strained marriage</h3><p class=align-left>Larry Bird attended Spring Valley High school, where he met his <a href=#>high school</a> sweetheart Janet Condra. They got married one year after he had joined Indiana State University on a basketball scholarship. Around that time, Larry's parents divorced, and his father left his mother to fend for their six children alone hence creating financial strains.</p><p class=align-left>Shortly after, Larry's dad, Claude Joseph, a Korean war veteran, committed suicide. His death affected Larry, who was then expecting a child with his wife, Janet. Larry's marriage started straining, and he asked for a divorce before abandoning his pregnant wife.</p><p class=align-left>Larry claimed that he wanted to focus on <a href=#>education</a> and his basketball career. He was successful in his quest until the court forced him to stand up to his responsibilities as a father. Corrie was also adamant about forming a relationship with him and even talked about it to the media.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/63a99ed75b32af00.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bryan Callen: divorce story, wife, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After his retirement, Larry Bird released an autobiography in which he touches on his relationship with Corrie. He states that he never pursued a relationship with her because of his differences with his ex-wife Janet.</p><h3>4. Bird had an interview with Oprah Winfrey</h3><p class=align-left>When Corrie Bird was 17 years old, she was invited to the famous Oprah Winfrey show for an interview. One of the topics they covered was her estranged relationship with her father. Corrie made it clear that she had always wanted her dad to acknowledge her existence and try to have a relationship with her, but it was never possible.</p><p class=align-left>She had even gone to the extent of writing him <a href=#>letters </a>and sending him her report cards via priority mail, but all her efforts were never reciprocated. Once in a while, she would coax her mother to go with her to her father's games to have a glimpse of him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3734ea541e82f561.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Match Game's Gene Rayburn: wife, net worth, children, tv shows, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Does Larry Bird's daughter play basketball? Yes. She was an outstanding <a href=#>basketball player</a> all through high school but never pursued it as a career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/32406cce4f5097e5.jpg><h3>5. Corrie has a good relationship with her siblings</h3><p class=align-left>In 1989, Larry walked down the aisle for the second time to marry his lover, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dinah Mattingly</a>. Together they adopted two children of both sexes going by the names; Mariah Bird and Connor Bird.</p><p class=align-left>Mariah has managed to stay away from the public eye, but her brother has been involved in many scandals. Some of the scandals include trying to run someone over with his car to underage drinking. But, all in all, Corrie has an excellent relationship with her half-siblings.</p><p class=align-left>Larry Bird's daughter, Corrie Bird, has had a thriving life of her own, from a budding family to a flourishing managerial career. Yet, somehow, she still managed to keep her father in good graces even after he denied her a couple of times.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2d1b7426112bea8d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Eve Schiff bio: husband, children, parents, net worth, measurements</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=# title>Tuko.co.ke </a>shared an article about the <i>Love Island</i> star, <a href=#>Brad McClelland</a>. The youthful labourer from Northumberland entered into the show with one mission, to find his better half. He was seeking a face-to-face dating experience, and his love for meeting new people was his card up the sleeve, or so he thought.</p><p class=align-left>Reconnecting with his sister, who he had never seen before, may not have been the happy ending Brad McClelland was hoping for when he joined Love Island, but it sure was the best thing to happen to him in a long time.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCywJyrrGWcnrOmtMCcoqxnk5q5pq7RoquyZZKevKi%2BwKmfop2jZIF0f5Ryb2abn6e%2FqrGMm6CrnF1qeqq6056pnquknruoecWamq2rXaGus77YZpmiqpSoeqWt1KCfrZ2iZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brian-white-and-valarie-pettiford.html><span>←</span><span>Brian White and Valarie Pettiford</span></a>
