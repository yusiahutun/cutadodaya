Not to take anything away from the way Chelsea did everything. I thought Roman did everything right for the club, but the difference is with City they're doing it year after year after year, and that's not something that comes easy. The mental challenges behind that and knowledge of the club to keep getting better and bigger."</p><p>Nearly three-quarters of the trophies City have won since their takeover have come in the Guardiola era. They were initially lagging well behind Chelsea, who won more than double the honours City did in their first decade after the money arrived, but are now just one trophy behind the London club's overall haul of 19, despite starting the race five years later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31386864.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/1_Manchester-City-v-BSC-Young-Boys-Group-G-UEFA-Champions-League-202324.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>It speaks to City's long-term planning, and the trust they've shown in the entire process. Wright-Phillips, who re-joined the Citizens a few days before the Abu Dhabi United Group took over, says it was clear from the start that the owners knew what they were doing.</p><p>"We all knew what they wanted to do and how they wanted to achieve it. We didn't think it would happen so quickly but the managers and signings they made along the way made that all possible," he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24212632.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_GettyImages-144868428.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article30670828.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_Manchester-City-v-Chelsea-FC-Premier-League.jpg><p>"[Roberto] Mancini, [Manuel] Pellegrini, Mark Hughes I thought did superbly. Now you've got the main man Pep who's probably the best manager the Premier League's seen in a very very long time, if not ever. He's taken the game forward, raising the standards of other managers like [Jurgen] Klopp, [Mikel] Arteta, [Roberto] De Zerbi and [Mauricio] Pochettino. There are so many managers that have progressed from what Pep has brought to the table."</p><p>Wright-Phillips began his career at City, emerging from the club's academy in 1999. He made over 180 appearances for them before being snapped up my newly-minted Chelsea in 2005. The midfielder landed the first pieces of silverware of his career at Stamford Bridge, winning the <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Premier League</a> in 2006 and the FA Cup in 2007, but left in 2008 after failing to nail down a starting spot in the team.</p><span class=disclaimer-text>This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.</span> <a href=#>Learn more</a> Watch the Champions League here <a class=affiliate-title href=# rel=nofollow>Catch every minute of the Champions League 2023/2024</a> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article30668223.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_Premier-League-Fixtures.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>TNT is the only place you can watch all the action from the Champions League this year.

Stints at QPR and in the States with the New York Red Bulls and Phoenix Rising followed before the midfielder hung up his boots in 2017.</p><p>City, who face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge later today, are favourites to land a fifth-successive Premier League title this season and can extend their lead at the top with a win. The Blues, meanwhile, are hoping to capitalise on their 4-1 win over <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Tottenham</a> on Monday, which was their first victory over a 'top 6' side since January 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Wopq2akaG5cLnAp2ScoaSueqS0xKWqnpldrL%2Bqs8etZKmgmaG5qrzSZmpqa2llgXR8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./poker-face.html><span>←</span><span>Poker Face TV Episode Recaps &amp;amp; News</span></a>
