Moore said that Putin’s government was beset by “venality, infighting and callous incompetence” and that the aftermath of Prigozhin’s mutiny had been “humiliating” to Putin.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/06/30/2023-06-08T161326Z_1_LWD848908062023RP1_RTRWNEV_C_8489-ART-AUCTION-RUBY-SOTHEBYS.00_00_38_14.Still025.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:17</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Wagner Group merchandise are hot items in Russia after revolt</p><p>Wagner Group merchandise are hot items in Russia after revolt</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Putin is likely to try to avoid giving the impression that he is overreacting to the mutiny, while trying to extract what he can of value from Prigozhin’s Wagner network, Burns said. Still, Burns said Prigozhin is likely to see retribution from Putin at some point.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Putin is the ultimate apostle of payback,” Burns said. “If I were Prigozhin, I wouldn’t fire my food taster.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Burns said the mutiny presented a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” for CIA recruitment in Russia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The agency recently made its first video post on Telegram, the social media and messaging site developed and widely used in Russia, to let Russians know how to contact it on the “dark web.” Burns said the video was viewed 2.5 million times in the week after it was posted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/06/30/2023-06-08T161326Z_1_LWD848908062023RP1_RTRWNEV_C_8489-ART-AUCTION-RUBY-SOTHEBYS.00_00_38_14.Still025.jpg>Burns, a diplomat before becoming the CIA chief, has emerged as a key backchannel for the Biden administration’s thorny relationships with Russia and China.
