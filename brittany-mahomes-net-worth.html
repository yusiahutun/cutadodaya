TikToker Jessica O’Connor Brittany of not tipping an <a href=# rel=nofollow>entire hotel staff after an alleged days-long stay</a>.</p><p>“My first interaction with her, she ran up over a $100 tab. She was with her whole posse — Patrick was not there — but I believe their tab was well over $100, maybe $130,” she recalled. “$0 tip.” O’Connor said she “let it slide” because “that happens sometimes,” but “they were there for almost a week I think. And did not tip a single one of our staff,” she further claimed. “Not only did she not tip, <a href=# rel=nofollow>she was just genuinely unpleasant</a>.”</p><p>While O’Connor conceded famous people don’t owe their fans anything, she said, “As a public figure, you should always go out thinking, ‘OK, the people I interact with are clocking these interactions and they’re going to remember this,’” she said. “And I will always remember that, Brittany,” she concluded, laughing.</p><p>This isn’t the first time <a href=#>Brittany has faced online scrutiny</a>. In December 2023, she addressed the rising negativity on her accounts on social media, slamming “rude” individuals and urging them to “go back to where you came from.” She wrote, “Recently there has been ALOT more rude ass people on here, waaaay more then[sic] normal,” she wrote in an Instagram story at the time.</p><p>Then, following the Kansas City Chief’s victory over the Ravens on January 28, 2024, she was captured in a&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TikTok video</a> asking a stadium employee for assistance in finding her way to the exit. <a href=#>“Where do we go from here?”</a> she asked. However, some viewers interpreted her “finger twirl” gesture as rude, sparking criticism of her treatment of the employee.</p><p>“It’s the where do we go from here with the finger twirl for me😳,” one commenter remarked, while others accused her of being “rude.” Another commenter claimed, “Mahomes wife needs to get up off her high horse. However, supportive voices also emerged, with one user expressing their understanding of the situation. “<a href=#>I don’t get the hate</a>,” they wrote. “I would ask the same question if I didn’t know🤷🏾‍♀️.” Another chimed in, “Not a Mahomes celebrity fan, but wife did nothing rude in the video. She simple asked a question. Much ado about nothing.”</p><p>Brittany responded by sharing a post to Instagram stories, writing: “I take rumors as a compliment. The fact that you’re bringing my name onto tables I don’t sit at shows your obsession. Stay bothered.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfl7%2BqwNOapbJlnZa1sLnErGSnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./blue-and-red-berry-star-galettes-sidebar.html><span>←</span><span>blue and red berry star galettessidebar</span></a>
