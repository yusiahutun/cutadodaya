All I have to say is I hope the younger generation is better at styling it than I was!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, the actress and haircare mogul is bringing her expertise—and legendary hair—to your shower with the introduction of LolaVie’s new shampoo and conditioner.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Restorative Shampoo contains good-for-your-hair ingredients like vitamin B and peptides to nourish and boost volume, while the Restorative Conditioner boasts vegan keratin, superfruit acai, and squalane for seriously soft hair. On par with LolaVie’s lineup, the set contains the brand’s signature citrusy, spa-like aroma. Your hair will never look (or smell) so good coming right out of the shower.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I’m a firm believer that if you feel that your hair looks good, you feel more confident,” Aniston says. “Consistently using products that are naturally derived, plant based, and clean has done wonders for my hair health and natural texture.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you’re a fan of Aniston’s beachy waves, you’re in luck. The actress says getting that signature undone look has never been easier thanks to her new products. “Since launching LolaVie, I’ve been embracing my natural texture more than ever,” she says. Her trick to lots of body and waves? “I like to wash my hair at night when I’m letting it go natural, because it dries nicely by morning, with that great bed-head look and texture.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though Aniston has been embracing her natural texture, her notable blowout look is still a go-to. “I always wash [my hair] the day of or right before I blow it out. I never feel pressured to change my hair. If it’s not broke, don’t fix it. I’m a creature of habit—not a hairstyle kind of girl. I’m no different than anyone else.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s true—Aniston is just like everyone else, especially when it comes to strategically planning out her hair washes for the week (relatable!).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“How often and when I wash my hair really depends on my schedule,” she says. “When I’m filming, I’m washing my hair a lot more often—basically every day. If not, I can usually get away with a few days in between washes.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The LolaVie Restorative Shampoo and Conditioner are $29 each and available to shop now online at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.lolavie.com/pages/cleanse-and-condition data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=lolavie.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">lolavie.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqGZmad8ooCQamlpbGRrfKuxzaegn52iYq6vtdKtpqdlnKS5osLInmSsoJGivbC7jJqlnWWTpLultdOipqedomQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./friendship-manor-launches-12-5m-campaign.html><span>←</span><span>Friendship Manor launches $12.5M campaign</span></a>
