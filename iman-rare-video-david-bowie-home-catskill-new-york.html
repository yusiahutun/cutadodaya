I would come maybe for a weekend and then grief hits me and then I will run back to the city.</strong> But because we were sheltering at home I had to sit down with my grief, and then it slowly, slowly, changed to joy. And all because of the landscape, the most beautiful sunsets every day and then walking around the property.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2768155e8392-iman-home-views-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eLkpcuAcmR8F data-wc=9><strong>The property, located in Catskill,&nbsp;has incredible mountain views</strong></p><p id=equFFZHiyCm1 data-wc=19>"What gave me a little bit of spiritual balance and quietness and solitude was that I started stacking stones.</p><p id=eZoo_uGY3voa data-wc=52>"I heard for many years that there are cultures all around the world that do stack, and some of it is for memorial, for people who passed away, and others it is for navigation purposes, so people when they come and see, they know that they are walking in the right direction.</p><p id=eut1v7oQpHTC data-wc=25>"So I love that balance, it's a memorial for somebody that passed away but it's there to finally say 'You are on the right track.'"</p><p id=eCKCgWwFDwua data-wc=79>Speaking about how the sunset inspired her fragrance's bottle, she added: "The sunsets here were so magical, so soothing, it reminded me about the Florentine sunsets, in Tuscany. When David and I used to go there, because we got married in Florence, so it was one of those magical sunsets that I remember from there, and then it was right in front of me every day. So the cap we wanted it to be the amber from the sunset."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
