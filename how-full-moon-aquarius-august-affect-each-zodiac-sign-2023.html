With the sun blazing through its sign of rulership, Leo, there’s an aura of playfulness and passion in the air. Authenticity is our greatest asset, especially when considering <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">how the full moon in Aquarius of August 2023 will affect each zodiac sign</a>. That said, if you’ve been contemplating your colorful musings, or wondering how you can cultivate your talents for the greater good, you’ll wanna check where the astrological axis of Leo-Aquarius is located on your birth chart. After all, in addition to witnessing your manifestations come into fruition, full moons illuminate what’s been hidden from our conscious mind.</p><p>This year’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">full moon in Aquarius </a>will take place on August 1 at 2:31 p.m. ET, and via nine degrees of this fixed air sign. For reference on your full-circle moment, think back to the new moon in Aquarius that took place on January 21, 2023. How has your social atmosphere evolved in the past six months? Reflect on the dynamic of your community affairs, as well as your sense of belonging in the world. The last air sign in the zodiac, the essence of Aquarius speaks to everything from one’s inner genius to their unique eccentricities. Its Uranian archetype is symbolic of our ideals, higher mind, and visions of the future. So, amidst <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the sun’s journey through show-stopping Leo</a>—bringing emphasis to your inner child and heart’s desires—the Aquarius full moon is putting a spotlight on your social environment, and clarifying whether it’s in support of your individual freedom.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/weeklyhoroscope4-3-23.png><p>A symbol of enlightenment, celebration, and culmination, the&nbsp;sun makes a direct opposition to the moon during this lunar phase, which also serves as a call for balance between the divine feminine and sacred masculine energies within us. It’s also important to note the influence of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Venus retrograde in Leo</a>, especially now <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">with the South Node</a> transiting Venus-ruled Libra. Whether financially or in terms of our relationships, this is encouraging us to get clear on our heart’s desires and unique value systems. Do your current relationships empower you, or trigger your inhibitions? Whether personally or professionally, we can no longer disregard the areas of life that lack an equal amount of give and take.</p><figure class=wp-block-pullquote readability=1><p>The full moon in Aquarius takes place on August 1 at 2:31 p.m. ET.</p></figure><p>When taking a closer look at this lunation’s astrology, it’s important to consider the influence of Aquarius’ co-rulers, Saturn and Uranus. Saturn, for instance, is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">currently retrograde in Pisces</a>, and Uranus will soon follow the taskmaster’s footsteps, beginning its annual retrograde journey in Taurus on August 28. While transiting methodical Virgo, the messenger planet will make a direct opposition to Saturn retrograde, triggering feelings of uncertainty, caution and/or general insecurity. That being said, if you’re feeling stifled or inhibited when communicating, don’t apply more pressure onto yourself. There’s a time and place for everything, so take a step back if you’re feeling skeptical.</p><p>Moreover, the full moon will face off with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jupiter—planet of abundance</a>, expansion, prosperity, and wisdom—whilst transiting the sensually driven sign of Taurus. This is not only magnifying the energy of this lunation, but also leading us towards brand-new avenues and opportunities for growth. Something is slowly but surely becoming more “real” and tangible, but there’s more. Mars will simultaneously harmonize with bountiful Jupiter—via an earthy and productive trine—which, in turn, energizes and supports our decisions moving forward. Venus retrograde’s square to Jupiter, however, adds a layer of shock and unconventionality to the mix, which is very Aquarian, so expect the unexpected!</p><p>If your&nbsp;<a href=#>sun sign</a>, <a href=#>moon sign</a> or <a href=#>rising sign</a> falls under any of the following zodiac signs, the upcoming full moon will be inspiring and rewarding. Here’s why:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.7787742899851><h2>Aries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aries.png><p>Your full-circle moment will likely revolve around your community affairs and individual freedom, as the moon will reach its peak of fullness in Aquarius, via your socially conscious 11th house of ideals, friendship and sense of belonging in the world. If you experience blockages with a day-to-day affair, don’t be discouraged.The good news is, your celestial ruler, Mars, will be in harmonious energy flow with lucky Jupiter, bringing you closer to your emotional fulfillment, and sense of security. Saturn will also continue to teach you the magic of faith and surrender. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.3109489051095><h2>Taurus</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taurus.png><p>The muse behind your sense of authority and professional affairs will become highlighted under this full moon. After all, it will touch down on your 10th house of reputation, which also happens to be the most public point in your birth chart. The best part? Lucky Jupiter is in your Venusian territory, let alone trining go-getter Mars in your fifth house of love, passion, and self-expression. Be it a personal or professional, you’re inspired to take the necessary risks, and you’re being celestially supported in the process. You’re shifting trajectories, and you’re making waves. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.8029294274301><h2>Gemini</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Gemini.png><p>You’re ready to explore other horizons, Gemini. If they asked you how or why, you wouldn’t be able to put your finger on it… but still, something inside you knows it’s time. Whether personally or professionally, you are more likely to question your sense of security at this time, but only because Mercury (your celestial ruler) is in opposition to Saturn. Trust your instincts, it’s safe to do so. Also, while Uranus transits your secretive 12th house, you’re more prone to move in secret. Nothing wrong with that, as a grounding Mars-Jupiter trine will intuitively guide you. A new world where you can express your individuality freely awaits. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.3773209549072><h2>Cancer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Cancer.png><p>You’re taking a closer look at everything from your intimate unions to your shared resources. This could be when in regards to friendship entanglements, or perhaps even your emotional exchanges via the virtual space. Has a connection reached its expiration date? The same goes for those of you earning a living via unconventional sources of income. Fortunately, with the support of a fruitful Mars-Jupiter trine, you have the help of your peers, and a map of dreams towards your soul purpose. The logistics of this decision may not make sense right away, and that’s OK. Make note of your intuitive downloads, financially or in terms of creative potentials. <a href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.3216253443526><h2>Leo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Leo.png><p>You were born to take the lead, but with power comes responsibility. This is especially true when considering the upcoming full moon, as it will ignite your committed seventh house of agreements, compromise and significant others. And with Aquarius’ rulers igniting your eighth house of intimate unions and 10th house of authority, the cosmos is asking you to be brutally honest with yourself, specifically when regarding future commitments. Venus retrograde is another prominent factor, as it continues to bring you inward, as a way to obtain clarity on what you wholeheartedly value, whether personally or professionally speaking.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.2762096774194><h2>Virgo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Virgo.png><p>Grounding your long term visions and dreams requires a certain amount of courage, and surrender. Fortunately, with the moon charging up your sixth house of rituals, details and due diligence, there’s an opportunity to obtain the clarity/insight you need to pursue your future endeavors. If this revolves around a significant partnership or commitment, a tense opposition between your celestial ruler, Mercury, and Saturn retrograde could trigger feelings of restriction and hesitation. Take a pause if needed, but lean on the invigorating essence of Mars in your sign, especially while in harmony with Jupiter. Some things are worth the risk, Virgo. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.3003597122302><h2>Libra</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Libra.png><p>How can you incorporate your unique attributes into your role as a leader? The moon rules your 10th house of authority, but it will peak via your sister air-sign, Aquarius, and charge up your fifth house of love, passion, pleasure and self-expression. Whether creatively or in terms of romance, this lunation is urging you to reflect on the ventures and commitments that no longer resonate with your ideals, and sense of belonging in the world. Keep in mind, Mercury’s opposition to Saturn could trigger feelings of uncertainty when in regards to your day-to-day affairs, but with your celestial ruler (Venus retrograde) in the mix, chances are you’re already in the process of re-evaluating/reflecting on your newly found value systems. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.86125><h2>Scorpio</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Scorpio.png><p>You’re redefining your idea of home and family under the light of this full moon. Community-based with a series of sparkly eccentricities, Luna will ignite your fourth house of emotional foundations, innermost feelings and living space(s). Relocating, perhaps? Maybe you’re contemplating whether to renew your apartment lease. Fueled by Uranus in your relationship sector and Saturn retrograde via your fifth house of authenticity, there will be an opportunity to reestablish your sense of security, specifically when it comes to your agreements, compromises and significant partnerships. In the meantime, reflect on the support and/or foundation you need in order to feel comfortable taking the lead. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.3504618937644><h2>Sagittarius</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sagittarius.png><p>What have you been doing for the greater good of your local community? Whether in terms of your immediate environment, or the relationship you share with your siblings, you are likely seeing a routine task and/or day-to-day affair come full circle. Saturn retrograde is also transiting your fourth house of family, not to mention in opposition with Mercury (via your 10th house of authority), bringing emphasis to your work vs. life balance. However, this could also revolve around a desire to be in authority… and yet, still feel blocked and/or stifled on the home front. Lean on the support of your peers, even if that requires a certain amount of courage from your end. Things are meant to change and expand in your daily routine, as it is for your highest good. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.2929104477612><h2>Capricorn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Capricorn.png><p>The moon governs your relationship sector, but it’s reaching its peak of fullness via your stability-seeking second house. Reality check! You’re more than likely seeing the value of a commitment, if not feeling the need to contemplate its worth entirely. Keep in mind, your celestial ruler, Saturn, will be in direct opposition to Mercury, adding a layer of uncertainty and tension, specifically those of you entertaining the thought of relocating, or perhaps committing to something long term. On a brighter note, Mars will harmonize with Jupiter via your fifth house of recognition and celebration, which can be equally as inspiring as it is validating for your forward movement. Trust your instincts. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.8252656434475><h2>Aquarius</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Aquarius.png><p>The moon is glimmering through the sky in your name, encouraging you to “feel” your feelings. For reference, think back to the new moon that took place in your sign back in January of this year. Your seeds of intention are coming to fruition, and with your co-rulers (Uranus and Saturn retrograde) bringing emphasis to your overall sense of security, chances are this revolves around your living situation, if not a family investment. On a more challenging note, Mercury will be making a direct opposition to taskmaster Saturn in your money sector, which can be financially stressful and/or generally ambiguous. However, there are other energies supporting your full-circle moment, some of which are already helping you come back home to yourself. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.7579062159215><h2>Pisces</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Pisces.png><p>Creatively or emotionally, you’re being called to go inward and explore the unique layers of your psyche. After all, with the full moon shaking up your 12th house of unconscious patterns, there is greater emphasis on your life behind the scenes. Resting, privacy, coping mechanisms and all, you could simultaneously come to terms with the boundaries that need to be set at this time. This is especially true with Saturn retrograde in your sign, as it is in the process of helping you restructure the foundation of your personal, and professional life. Although, while in opposition to Mercury, many of you could feel blocked and/or inhibited with a significant other, specifically when in an attempt to communicate. Fortunately, as long as there is truth, a grounded Mars-Jupiter trine will support your forward movement. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Read your full monthly horoscope here</a>.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfnby4ecWuo6VlnaS8r3nAqqyaqpmqwG6t1KCsrKxdlrOnscKtZJ6Zk516u7vDopicZaOetK95kWlpbGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./danny-masterson-and-bobette-riales.html><span>←</span><span>Danny Masterson and Bobette Riales</span></a>
