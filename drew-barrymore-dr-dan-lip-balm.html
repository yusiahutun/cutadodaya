However, I should be able to save some extra cash this time around thanks to a $7 lip balm that Drew Barrymore swears by to keep her lips hydrated at all times.</p><p>The actress recently praised Dr. Dan’s CortiBalm Lip Balm (<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Buy at Walmart, $7.50</a>) in a fall edition of <a href=# rel=noopener>Drew’s Little Yellow Book</a>, a weekly round up of her favorite products she’s using at the moment. She first came across this lip balm after her dermatologist recommended it and it’s been her go-to ever since. While she often wears lipstick for work including hosting her talk show The Drew Barrymore Show, she notes that this lip balm gives her “much relief from product overload!”</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>It contains a mild hypoallergenic blend of petroleum jelly, beeswax, mineral oil and one percent hydrocortisone. This formula works to reduce inflammation caused by sunburn, certain medications, or cosmetic products that result in <a href=#>chapped lips</a>. Barrymore says that it’ll especially help during the fall and winter months when the dry air can draw moisture from our lips and cause them to become cracked. Barrymore even says she keeps one stick of this lip balm in every pocket!</p><h2 class=block-product__title><a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Dr. Dan’s CortiBalm Lip Balm</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Dr.-Dans-CortiBalm.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Buy at Walmart, $7.50</a></strong></p><h3 class=block-product-list__title>Why we like it:</h3><ul><li>Can treat all types of mild to severe chapped lips</li><li>Contains a mild hypoallergenic blend of ingredients</li><li>Reduces inflammation associated with chapped lips</li></ul><p><strong>Happy customer:</strong> “This is a great product.
