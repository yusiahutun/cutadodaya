The songs that came from this time in my life were marked by their brutal honesty, unfiltered diaristic confessions and wild wistfulness. I love this album because it tells a tale of growing up, flailing, flying and crashing … and living to speak about it. With six extra songs I’ve sprung loose from the vault, I absolutely cannot wait to celebrate Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) with you on July 7th.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/travis-kelce-kiss-marry-kill-taylor-swift.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reba-mcentire-taylor-swift.jpg><p>So more than a decade later, what are <a href=# id=auto-tag_taylor-swift data-tag=taylor-swift>Taylor Swift</a>‘s new lyrics to “Better Than Revenge”? Read more to find out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=what-are-taylor-swift-s-new-lyrics-to-better-than-revenge>What are Taylor Swift’s new lyrics to “Better Than Revenge”?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taylor-swift.jpg><p>What are Taylor Swift’s new lyrics to “Better Than Revenge”? The Midnights songwriter changed the line “She’s an actress but she’s better known for things she does on a mattress.” to “He’s a moth to the flame, while she’s holding the matches.”</p><p>The song is allegedly about Camilla Belle who dated <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1197570/taylor-swift-boyfriend/>Joe Jonas</a> after Taylor did. Many critics took the line to be slut-shaming Belle. Upon years of reflection, she told The Guardian in 2014. “I was 18 when I wrote that,” she told the site. “That’s the age you are when you think someone can actually take your boyfriend. Then you grow up and realise no one take someone from you if they don’t want to leave.”</p><p>In 2015, Belle responded to Katy Perry’s tweet as the “California Girls” singer tweeted: “Finding it ironic to parade the pit women against other women argument about as one unmeasurably capitalises on the takedown of a woman…” Belle <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://twitter.com/CamillaBelle/status/624238383468933120 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied, </a>““Couldn’t have said it better…” which many Swifties believe to be directed towards Swift.</p><p>Years later, Taylor has the chance to undo what she wrote and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/1197536/taylor-swift-net-worth/>change it</a> into something more of her feminist image of today. Some Swifties are still holding onto the old lyrics for old nostalgia purposes. “gaslighting myself that better than revenge rumors are not true for my own mental sanity,” one person <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://twitter.com/hotmessjunk/status/1676834734188658690>tweeted. </a>“We just have to bully her into releasing Better Than Revenge (Taylor’s Version) (Slut Shaming Version) like she did with lana and snow on the beach,” another <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://twitter.com/e_matron/status/1677023356904951808>tweeted.</a></p><p>Weeks before the release of Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), Swift warned her fans about behavior when the record is released. “I was hoping to ask you, that as we lead up to this album coming out, I would love for that kindness and that gentleness to extend onto our internet activities,” Swift said, per&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>fan-recorded videos</a>&nbsp;from the show. “So what I’m trying to say is, I’m putting this album out because I want to own my music and I believe that any artist who has the desire to own their music should be able to. That’s why I’m putting out this album.”</p><p>She continued, “I’m 33 years old, I don’t care about anything that happened to me when I was 19 except the songs I wrote and the memories we made together. So what I’m trying to tell you is that I am not putting this album out so you should feel the need to defend me on the internet against someone you think I wrote a song about 14 million years ago when I was 19.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=taylor-swift-better-than-revenge-taylor-s-version-lyrics>Taylor Swift “Better Than Revenge” (Taylor’s Version) lyrics</h2><p>Here are Taylor Swift’s “Better Than Revenge” lyrics via Genius.</p><p>[Intro]<br>Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did<br>Ha, time for a little revenge</p><p>[Verse 1]<br>The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and<br>I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him<br>She came along, got him alone, and let’s hear the applause<br>She took him faster than you can say “Sabotage”<br>I never saw it coming, wouldn’t have suspected it<br>I underestimated just who I was dealing with<br>She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum<br>She underestimated just who she was stealing from</p><p>[Chorus]<br>She’s not a saint and she’s not what you think<br>She’s an actress, woah<br>He’s a moth to the flame while she’s holding the matches, woah<br>Soon, she’s gonna find stealing other people’s toys<br>On the playground won’t make you many friends<br>She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind<br>There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha</p><p>[Verse 2]<br>She looks at life like it’s a party and she’s on the list<br>She looks at me like I’m a trend and she’s so over it<br>I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and<br>She thinks I’m psycho ’cause I like to rhyme her name with things<br>But sophistication isn’t what you wear or who you know<br>Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go<br>Oh, they didn’t teach you that in prep school so it’s up to me<br>But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity<br>(Think about what you did)</p><p>[Chorus]<br>She’s not a saint and she’s not what you think<br>She’s an actress, woah<br>She’s better known for the things that she does<br>On the mattress, woah<br>Soon, she’s gonna find stealing other people’s toys<br>On the playground won’t make you many friends<br>She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind<br>There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha</p><p>[Bridge]<br>I’m just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey<br>You might have him, but haven’t you heard?<br>I’m just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey<br>You might have him, but I always get the last word<br>Woah, woah-ah-oh</p><p>[Chorus]<br>She’s not a saint and she’s not what you think<br>She’s an actress, woah (She deserved it)<br>She’s better known for the things that she does<br>On the mattress, woah<br>Soon, she’s gonna find stealing other people’s toys<br>On the playground won’t make you many friends<br>She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind<br>There is nothing I do better than revenge</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
