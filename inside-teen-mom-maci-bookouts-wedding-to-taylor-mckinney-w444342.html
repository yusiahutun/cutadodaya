At her October 8 nuptials to <b>Taylor McKinney</b>, the MTV star, 25, incorporated all three of her children into the ceremony, she reveals in the new issue of<i> Us Weekly</i>, which features exclusive photos of the big day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>At the Honey Lake Church in Greenville, Florida, Bookout’s 7-year-old son, Bentley (with her ex Ryan Edwards), served as “mini best man,” says McKinney, 27. The boy escorted his sister, flower girl Jayde, 16 months, down the aisle while pulling 4-month-old Maverick in a wagon. (Bookout had her younger two children with McKinney.)</span></p><p>Then, as the Josh Abbott Band’s “She’s Like Texas” played (a nod to McKinney’s home state), Bookout — clad in a strapless lace and chiffon Riki Dalal Haute Couture gown — strode to her love of four years. “Maci was a gorgeous bride!” guest and MTV costar <b><a href=#>Catelynn Lowell</a></b> tells <i>Us.</i> “I was excited when I saw her.”&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt width=1000 height=1355 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The Chattanooga, Tennessee–­based pair’s self-penned vows stirred emotions as well. “Taylor talked about their family, but he would throw in jokes about football,” says Lowell. “Maci explained their story and how they met. She was getting teary!”</p><p><span>In keeping with the family theme, Pastor Jack D. Sylvester (the bride’s grandfather!) married them. Just before 6 p.m., he pronounced the pair husband and wife, and the 165 guests jumped to their feet, applauding. Gushes Bookout, who departed the church with ­McKinney in a horse-drawn carriage: “I’m excited to finally be able to call Taylor my husband!”</span></p><p>The newlyweds made their debut as Mr. and Mrs. at a rustic-theme reception at Honey Lake Resort’s Lakeside Pavilion, taking the floor to dance to “All of Me” by John Legend. “They were both beaming,” guest Kirsten Malone, a <i>Teen Mom</i> exec producer, tells <i>Us.</i> “They looked like they were exactly where they wanted to be.”</p><p>As the night wore on, the party amped up. DJ Barnaby Xaphakdy spun tunes such as Wiz Khalifa’s “Taylor Gang” and Lil Wayne’s “­Lollipop” — much to the enjoyment of Bookout’s eldest. “Bentley was running around like crazy,” says Lowell. “He was having a blast!”</p><p>For much more on the wedding, including exclusive photos, pick up the new issue of <i>Us Weekly,</i> on stands now!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaipqOesaZ5056cp2WdpLpuucCcoGaan6S4sMHTrGSwnZSZtq%2BzjK2mZqyRrrmwvoymmqShnqOyunnWbWtta2RnfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-your-brain-reacts-to-humour.html><span>←</span><span>How Your Brain Reacts to Humour</span></a>
