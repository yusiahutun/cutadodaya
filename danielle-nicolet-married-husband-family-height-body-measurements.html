With an acting career spanning more than two decades, Nicolet has established herself as a versatile actress who performs each of her roles brilliantly.</p><p>Her first big recurring TV role was on “3rd Rock from the Sun”, where she played for 45 episodes. Since then she has made numerous guest appearances on shows such as Undressed, Moesha, Stargate SG-1 and many others.</p><p>Her most prominent role, however, was in the TV series “Born Again Virgin”, where she played the leading role. The series lasted 2 seasons and 14 episodes before it was canceled at the end of 2016.</p><p>Lately, Danielle seems to have focused on the big screen. Alongside Dwayne Johnson alias The Rock and comedian Kevin Hart, Danielle played the American action comedy film Central Intelligence in 2016, which became a box-office hit and earned over 220 million dollars from a budget of 50 million dollars. Kevin received a People’s and Teen Choice Award for his role.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Danielle-Nicolet-640x488.jpg><p>Danielle’s other latest films are Believe and Netflix’s Deidra & Laney Rob a Train. With increasing popularity, fans have developed an interest in their personal lives.</p><p>In this article, we will examine details of her romantic life, her early life story and of course her body measurements.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Cassi Davis Age, Husband, Children, Bio, Married</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Danielle Nicolet Married/Husband</strong></h2><p>Danielle may seem to have this always young, seductive look, but she is far from a spring chicken – she was born in 1973…. does the mathematics. Her age has made many fans wonder whether she is single or married. Well, don’t wonder anymore, Danielle Nicolet is a married woman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Danielle-Nicolet-body.jpg><p>Many sites out there claim that the ace actress is single, but that’s absolutely wrong, we can confirm. Well, you can’t really blame them for discovering information about Danielle’s private life is not the easiest thing to do. For one thing, she’s super mysterious and not one of those celebrities who keep blowing the horn about her private life.</p><p>So, how did we get to her marital status? Well, we’ve done our research.</p><p>In 2015, when Danielle was playing Virgo in Born Again, she gave an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview with ABC Radio</a> and spilled some information about her love life.</p><p>For those who haven’t seen Born Again Virgin, the story follows a girl named Jenna (Danielle Nicolet) who decides to become celibate after a series of unsuccessful relationships. However, her dissolution is not easy to keep, as she is constantly tempted by her very seductive neighbor Donovan (Durrell “Tank” Babbs).</p><p>In this interview, Danielle told ABC that she could fully relate to Jenna’s story, as she once decided to remain celibate until marriage. Like Jenna’s, her decision came after a series of failed relationships with a person who ruined her heart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Danielle-Nicolet-Biography.jpg><p>“I went through a phase before I met my husband where I got out like one bad relationship after another. And just like Jenna had that insight, I seemed to feel super attracted to Jacka********, how really handsome, really, really, really mean, kinda idiotic Jacka******. And I realized that maybe I needed to sort something out with myself,” Danielle said to ABC.</p><p>In another <a href=# rel=noopener>interview with JETMAG</a>, Danielle revealed details about her celibacy and said;</p><p>“…….Taking a break from sex allowed me to open my eyes, mind, and heart to another type of person. I think taking that time really helped me open up to better relationships with sentimental good men. I don’t know if they are connected, but I met my husband. He was my next big relationship after that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Danielle-Nicolet-husband.jpg><p>She also spoke about her husband’s name – Mike Kussman. Wait a minute! Google doesn’t, he’s not a celebrity, so to speak. Mike is just a normal guy who prefers to be very reserved about social issues. But he enjoys sharing pictures of himself and his wife.</p><p>Unfortunately, we can’t confirm the exact date on which the duo tied the knot………</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Mike’s Instagram Page</a>, he’s a builder and designer at <a href=# rel=noopener>SLTWTR Company</a>, which deals with luxurious furniture designs. Follow him on <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter</a>.</p><p>Likewise,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Danielle’s Instagram page</a>&nbsp;is awash with pictures of her and her white beau. On Mike’s birthday on June 7th, 2017, Danielle dedicated this post to him saying;</p><figure class=wp-block-embed></figure><p>She couldn’t seem happier, right? While Danielle has made clear her marital status, we can’t tell if she has kids or not. Her IG page has no pictures of her with her child or family member.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Jamie Luner’s Bio, Married, Husband, Measurements, Wiki</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Brief Bio/Family</strong></h2><p>Danielle Nicolet was born on November 24, 1973, as Danielle Patricia Diggs in a working-class neighborhood in Ashtabula, Ohio.
