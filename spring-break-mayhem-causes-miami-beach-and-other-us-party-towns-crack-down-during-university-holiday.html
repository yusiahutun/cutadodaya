We welcome people to come and have a good time. What we don’t welcome is criminal activity. What we don’t welcome is mayhem and people who want to wreak havoc on our communities.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/3b92ffc5-b2b7-40f5-ae12-601816635bb5_bbfdc955.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most spring break activity centres around a 10-block stretch of Ocean Drive known for its art deco hotels, restaurants and nightclubs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">David Wallack, owner of South Beach restaurant and nightclub Mango’s Tropical Cafe, says Miami Beach has always thrived on celebration, and choking visitor access would turn the vibrant, eclectic city into a retirement community.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I believe we need to create something big, another big event in March because March has fallen off the edge of the cliff,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/6a0a05a2-2388-4382-822c-1111f99d04d8_0c42f09f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Wallack and others have proposed a large music festival during the third week of spring break – when aimless and unruly crowds tend to reach their climax – with the hope that attendees will disperse the loitering mobs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meiner said the city had spent millions of dollars on concerts and other events in the past that had done little to mitigate the violence. He said businesses suffered when violent mobs gathering along Ocean Drive forced them to close, adding that the people who are primarily causing the problems aren’t spending money in the city anyway.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They’re not staying in the hotels,” Meiner said. “They’re not visiting our businesses.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/9f5c3610-380b-49cb-8885-376fd70458ee_266418ee.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/05fb0eda-ea7f-4e2c-bc57-e22fb2370e40_55c83460.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some civil rights advocates, however, believe the restrictions are racially motivated.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">South Beach became popular among black tourists about two decades ago as promoters organised Urban Beach Week during May’s Memorial Day weekend.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many locals have complained about violence and other crime associated with the event, which led to an increased police presence. But the event’s continued popularity correlates to heightened black tourism throughout the year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/83ca23a5-9f65-4ba0-8ecb-1a0d4fd69db6_595de0ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Stephen Hunter Johnson, a lawyer and member of Miami-Dade Black Affairs Advisory Board, says city officials are only cracking down so hard because many of the visitors are black. But Meiner rejects the notion. “I have a moral obligation to keep people safe, and right now, it is not safe,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The long-time spring break destination of Panama City Beach, in northwest Florida, has experienced a similar escalation in violent crime, but Police Chief Eusebio Talamantez attributes that to people taking advantage of the environment, not actual university students on spring break.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When you think of spring break, you might think of vacation, a collegiate break, maybe some fist fights and some keg stands [a drinking activity in which the participant does a handstand on a keg of beer],” Talamantez says. “It has evolved into shootings, mass riots, rape and homicide.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">9 of the best city destinations with beaches, from Miami to Sydney to Rio</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Panama City Beach’s violence came to a head in 2015, when a house party shooting left seven people wounded. The city subsequently banned alcohol on the beach and cracked down on unpermitted events.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">City businesses sued, claiming the new rules unfairly targeted events popular with black visitors, but the lawsuit was dropped several months later.</p>Talamantez says the measures were somewhat successful, but a massive hurricane in late 2018, and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Covid-19</span></a> lockdowns in 2020, disrupted the city’s ability to manage crowds once pandemic restrictions were lifted, leading to a resurgence in violence.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/03/06/dc66e719-dfd3-43c8-9e7b-099b4db349c4_55c83460.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A renewed crackdown in 2023, however, led to a 44 per cent reduction in crime, and the city is imposing similar rules this year. Talamantez says he doubts anything Miami Beach is doing will be more strict than the enforcement measures in Panama City Beach.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’re just trying to create an environment that says loud and clear in big bold letters that we are a municipality of law and order,” Talamantez says. “And law and order does not go away just because you’re on spring break.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZMGzrdWeo2aklZ7Atr7EaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtsbWtkbny0vNGipaBlkqeyoreMppiyoJWieqSt1KycrGWdnq6utYybnJqbmGKur7CMqKuhnaJiwrR5z5qprbFdqby4utJmmquZk6B6pbvWp2SdraKeu6h51Kegr52iqLa1xYyhpqWhlJbG</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-chris-harrington-meet-angie-harrington-husband.html><span>←</span><span>Meet RHOSLC Angie Harrington Husband, Chris Harrington!</span></a>
