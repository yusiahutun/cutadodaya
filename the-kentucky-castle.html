And what better place to do that than in a stately, medieval-style castle with luxury accommodations, fine dining and romantic gardens? If you want to go somewhere you can feel like a queen without needing to have the coffers of one, look no further than Versailles, Kentucky. You read that right: The U.S. has its own Versailles — and it’s just a stone’s throw from Louisville. Here, learn more about The Kentucky Castle, and why it’s an ideal place for your inner princess and her knight in shining armor to spend a night or two.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A real-life castle in Kentucky</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/Aerial-of-The-Kentucky-Castle-at-Sunset-1.jpg><p>Situated on an 110-acre estate in the lush valleys of central Kentucky, right outside Lexington in an aptly named town called Versailles, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Kentucky Castle</a> was built in 1969 by a couple&nbsp; inspired by the beautiful architecture they saw on their European honeymoon.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Unfortunately, construction issues, a divorce, and even a fire halted the castle’s progress. In 2017, new owners brought fresh life to the property, and made it their goal to allow guests to experience “Southern hospitality within the walls of a castle.” It’s now a beloved and unique fixture of Central Kentucky.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Feel like a queen in the ‘Bluegrass State’&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/Interior-of-The-Kentucky-Castle.jpg><p><a href=#>Many girls dream</a> of living like a princess in a fairy tale — without the whole getting-locked-in-a-tower-and-needing-rescue part, of course. The Kentucky Castle makes those dreams come true, and its towers are so lovely that you may actually want to lock yourself away for a while. Read on for more about the pet-friendly luxury lodging, unique amenities, and fine dining that can make your getaway memorable.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Relax in elegant chambers</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/Guest-Room-at-The-Kentucky-Castle-2.jpg><p>The Kentucky Castle features 18 rooms: four of those are Tower Suites, and one is a separate cabin with a view of the farm. And while you feel like you’re staying in a Medieval estate, the rooms are anything but old-fashioned. Each room is outfitted with charming, antique furniture and all the modern amenities you need, including a minibar, kitchenette, private balcony, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and more</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/Farmview-Chalet-first-floor.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Enjoy farm-to-table dining</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/Food-Shot-at-The-Kentucky-Castle.jpg><p>What’s the point of living like nobility if you don’t get to feast? The Kentucky Castle features an on-site restaurant, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Castle Farm</a>, that serves upscale, seasonal cuisine made using only fresh ingredients from local suppliers and their own gardens. With its proximity to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bourbon Trail</a>, where some of the state’s best distilleries are, you can expect delicious local cocktails as well.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/Outside-Patio-at-The-Kentucky-Castle.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Take a dip in the pool and tour the grounds on horseback</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/Outdoor-Pool.jpg><p>Just because you’re there for the relaxing Royal treatment doesn’t mean you can’t have a little fun, too. The Kentucky Castle features <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one-of-a-kind experiences</a> like tours of the castle and gardens and horseback riding, and quirkier activities like Murder Mystery dinners and goat yoga (literally, yoga with goats).</p><p>You can interact with the farm animals, have a picnic in the gardens, take an art class or simply relax by the swimming pool or <a href=#>in the spa</a>. The only thing you won’t be able to do at The Kentucky Castle is get bored.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/Baby-Goat_Rosemary.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Explore Kentucky outside the castle walls</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/horse-farm-manchester-2.jpg><p>Though you probably won’t want to leave The Kentucky Castle, there’s only more adventure awaiting you outside its walls. Lexington, Kentucky is world-renowned for its bourbon distilleries, and is also the home to a wide variety of unique activities and culture. Though Louisville is the home of the Kentucky Derby, Lexington is “The Horse Capital of the World” with<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> its rolling landscapes</a> full of horse farms.</p><p>Take in the majestic Appalachian Mountains on a hike, go on a tour of its historical sites, and enjoy the live music, art galleries, and other creative cultural fixtures that have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">earned it the nickname</a> “Athens of the West.”</p><p>If you’re looking to have a weekend you won’t forget, take a look at The Kentucky Castle. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Visit their website to book</a>, and enjoy your stay, your majesty!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJoq6uZppq5cMDHnmSknZ6pwqS32GaamqukobI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./get-real-latlong-coordinates-from-google-maps.html><span>←</span><span>Get Real Lat/Long Coordinates from Google Maps Chris Coyier</span></a>
