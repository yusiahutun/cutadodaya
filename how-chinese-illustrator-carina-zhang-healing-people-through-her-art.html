She retreated into her art.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I felt lonely when I moved to the US,” says Zhang via video call from the US. “I was struggling and kept asking myself, ‘How can I make friends? How can people better understand me?’”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Gay cruising spot or sacred Hong Kong wishing tree?

Ron Hubbard Illustrators of the Future Contest, earning her a trip to Hollywood this month for a week-long masterclass workshop.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The awards ceremony takes place on April 25, while her winning art will be published in May in the anthology L. Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of the Future Volume 40.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The list of judges for the competition reads like a “who’s who” from the world of illustration, and includes fantasy artists Larry Elmore (Dungeons & Dragons book covers), Bob Eggleton and Rob Prior (art for Spawn, Heavy Metal comics and Buffy the Vampire Slayer).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/19/c1ffc37c-c44e-436b-8c87-c29bb8c64220_9344ebd2.jpg>One judge stands out to Zhang: Australian illustrator and past contestant winner <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Shaun Tan</span></a>, known for his books that deal with social and historical subjects through dreamlike imagery. In 2011, he won an Academy Award (best short animated film) for The Lost Thing.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m so inspired by Shaun and admire his work ethic, not just because of his whimsical and playful illustrations but because he addresses serious issues like immigration,” Zhang says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tan showed her how art could be used as a tool for positive social change. She is now focusing on a career as a psychotherapist.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I want to use my skills to help people, and storytelling is such a healing process in the clinical field,” she says, adding she plans to work with non-English-speaking Hispanic immigrants “so art can be a form of language – a tool to tell their story”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/19/05313c71-4ebf-4e19-b406-d80ae94f25d2_2fae971e.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/19/38c3b29d-fb28-4583-90f0-416f2077a44f_0c274a00.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Combining art with therapy could boost her job prospects; as an international student, finding work in the US is complicated. Another obstacle is the rise of artificial intelligence, she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t think I could rely just on illustration to make a living – it might just cover the rent in New York.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Developing art therapy in her native China is also on her wish list.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A lot of people suffer from chronic stress but the culture in China is to discourage people, especially men, from being vulnerable. I want to address this issue.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/19/18826ec5-468d-4d58-bdc2-c3d95ff4f66f_db76aa8f.jpg>Zhang makes it clear that she is fully aware of the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">story behind L. Ron Hubbard</span></a>, who founded the Writers of the Future contest in 1983 to support aspiring writers, and who penned hundreds of published stories, including the science fiction novel Battlefield Earth.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For most people, Hubbard’s name is inextricably linked to Scientology, the religious movement he founded in the early 1950s that, in a nutshell, believes that people are immortal alien beings trapped on earth in human bodies. Hollywood stars Tom Cruise and John Travolta are high-profile followers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is all about perspective, Zhang says. “It depends on how you think about it,” she says of the award, whose past winners have published 2,000 novels and almost 6,300 short stories between them, including 36 New York Times bestsellers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Myself and many other artists who have won this award are grateful for its legacy that brings so many talented and kindhearted artists together.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/19/790e7b6e-3680-4486-8aae-4082aef72513_8fd09f3b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many artists who care about social justice and activism are among the underprivileged, she says, which makes art education and funding vital in supporting voices from diverse backgrounds. But awards have become highly institutionalised, Zhang says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There are few well-organised art awards that are open to the public that help people who don’t have the privilege of being in art school,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That’s why I’m planning a non-profit organisation to use art and education to support underprivileged groups.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I want to host fundraising art sales and art therapy workshops to teach creative skills to disadvantaged groups, build supportive communities and improve social well-being.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6zwNJmmq6kpKq%2FpnvAq6uim5yafHR%2BlHJtaWpfnby4ecKhoKedo5p6qrjLrqqtqpGpvLN5wpqpoqaRYseprc2gZKGdkaG2r7OMqZyoqJyaerW00aisoKBdnbKzecCrqw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ernestine-sclafani.html><span>←</span><span>Ernestine Sclafani Bio, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth</span></a>
