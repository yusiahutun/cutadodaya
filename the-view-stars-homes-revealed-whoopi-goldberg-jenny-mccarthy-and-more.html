It was originally built in 1927.&nbsp;During an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>New York Magazine</a>, The View host reflected on her decision to move at the time, explaining that she'd been seeking more privacy after feeling "a bit besieged" in the city, specifically while living in Manhattan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=efuwbvbSXoCt data-wc=13><strong>Whoopi Goldberg's&nbsp;$2.8-million mansion includes a beige and cream kitchen with granite countertops</strong></p><p id=e6qOypxPDftE data-wc=51>An eight-bedroom seven-bathroom Colonial-style property, Whoopi occasionally gives fans a glimpse into her lavish home on Instagram, including her beige and cream kitchen, which includes statement granite countertops.

A decadent 1920s property with plenty of history, it had originally been built for Governor Herbert H.

Embarking on six months of renovations, the award-winning journalist and lawyer may have installed a completely new kitchen, but she&nbsp; "stayed true to the home" by preserving the hardwood floors, the original staircase and stained-glass windows.&nbsp;</p><p id=ekA-YyEEU75x data-wc=27>Opting for a warm color scheme that includes hints of mustard yellow, Sunny also revealed that she'd accessorized her home with beautiful Latin, Caribbean and African art.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Joy Behar's house in the Hamptons</h2><p id=e9cfLSP281sk data-wc=48>Joy Behar boasts a huge property portfolio that includes multiple homes in the US, but in 2021, The View panellist gave&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Hedges</a> a rare glimpse into her home in the Hamptons.

Joy has been living in her current Hamptons home for almost a decade, and she couldn't love it more. "This house is over 100 years old — I'm almost as old as this house!" she said. "But it's a beautiful house, it has bones, and it has history."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/24515b874fbf-joy-behar-garden-pool-z.jpg><p id=eTsFwsMnnjzB data-wc=13><strong>The View star has said "there is no better place" then the Hamptons</strong></p><p id=eu37BsElYPM9 data-wc=81>Describing her taste as "eclectic modern," Joy also spoke about her love of local tag sales and estate sales, which she uses to find secret treasures for her home.&nbsp;While her previous work on The View had required her to head back to Manhattan, the mom-of-one was always eager to return. "I love the Hamptons. There is no better place. To me, it resembles Provence more than any other place I've been, and I like it more than Provence," Joy said.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Meghan McCain's house in Washington DC</h2><p id=ejgmVDLtIDaD data-wc=63>Meghan McCain has properties across New York and Los Angeles, but she's also spent a lot of time at her home in Washington DC.
