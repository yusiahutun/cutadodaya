The show revolves around family, drugs and Detroit takes us into the world of the Flenory brothers who established one of the largest drug organizations in America.</p><p>The 50 Boyz is Meech (Demetrius Flenory Jr) and <a href=# rel>Terry's</a> (Da'Vinchi) gang but it has a mole in it. Unbeknownst to them, Kato (Ajiona Alexus) has been tipping off <a href=# rel>Lamar</a> (Eric Kofi-Abrefa) about the group's activities but we don't know why, All we know is that there is danger within the ranks itself which Meech and Terry exposed without their knowledge. Read on to know what happened in <a href=# rel>Episode 7</a> and what questions it raised.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'Black Mafia Family' Episode 6: Lamar murders an innocent kid, fans say 'he gotta go'</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Black Mafia Family' Episode 4: Kato proves to be a snitch, fans want her dead</a></p><h2 class=split>Who is Kato's real target?</h2><p>Previous episodes of 'BMF' saw Kato under Lamar's thumb, doing his bidding by spying on the 50 Boyz for undisclosed reasons. Episode 7 finally lets us in on the reason behind her allegiance to Lamar. 'All in the Family' saw Kato fatally attack Detective Lopez which resulted in his death. Although she doesn't know he died she knows that the hit she delivered was deadly. Distraught and scared she comes crying to B-Mickie's house where he comforts her. The two after sleeping together feel like smoking up but are out of rolling papers. While B-Mickies goes to the store forgetting his gun at home we see Lamar give Kato a nasty surprise by breaking. He expresses his doubts regarding her loyalty and threatens to kill her if she double-crosses him. He tells her to kill Meech while he'll take out Terry. After he leaves we see B-Mickie arrive shortly but while making conversation casually he takes his gun and points it at Kato. He's spotted Lamar leaving his house and confronts her about what he was doing. Breaking down she comes clean and tells him that Lamar used to work closely with her dad and when she was younger he took care of a body for her and even took the blame for the charge. She cries telling him she's scared of the crazy man and that the 50 Boyz are her family and asks B-Mickie to help take him out with her.</p><p>Now although she says that she doesn't want anything to do with Lamar and wants to kill him, will she actually go through with it? She may consider the 50 Boyz her family now but will she betray the man who helped her out in need, a man so close to her father that he took care of a body and ate the charge for her? Is she truly switching over to the 50 Boyz or did she say that to B-Mickie to save her skin at that moment? Anything could go down with the tricky girl in this case. Watch the next episode to find out what happens.</p><p>'BMF' airs Sunday night at 8 pm ET on Starz.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRomp2beqO4wJyiZqWRm7aiecWapKKkqWKysbXSqJueZWdixKq4y2aimqyfYsGivsaeq2allZqwqXnOq2SlmZ2Wv26%2Fz6igpZ2iqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-cole-sillinger-s-girlfriend-what-know-blue-jackets-prospect-s-relationship-tate-mcrae.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Cole Sillinger's girlfriend?
