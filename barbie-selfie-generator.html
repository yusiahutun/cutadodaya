Usually that’s where the best stuff is, where you’re like, ‘I am terrified of that.’ Anything where you’re like, ‘This could be a career-ender’—then you’re like, ‘I should probably do it.’”</p><p>Barbie herself <a rel=noopener href=#>Margot Robbie</a> gushed about the film’s arduous production and it will definitely fulfill all your expectations. “You’ll see some dream houses. And it will be everything you ever dreamed of…,” she said on Variety’s <a rel="noopener nofollow" href=#>Actors on Actors</a> series. “I’ve been working on it for about four or five years now — it’s a LuckyChap project. And we went after Greta. There were maybe three people that we would want to make a Barbie movie with, and I was like, if she says no …. So thank God she said yes. She’s just brilliant.”</p><p>As for Ryan Gosling, he’s excited to bring Ken’s life to well…IRL Kens. &nbsp;“Finally, it’s happening. This has been coming my whole life. I felt like I was seeing myself. I felt seen,” Ryan joked to <a href=#>Variety</a>. “I think a lot of Kens will feel seen when they see this. Gotta do it for the Kens. Nobody plays with the Kens.”</p><p>There are even non-dolls in the Barbie movie like Will Ferrell who plays the CEO of Mattel. “Misguided but in an innocent way. He just cares about little girls and their dreams in the least creepy way possible,” Robbie describes his character. Gloria, played by America Ferrera is also in the mix of non-Barbies. “I think I can say that my character has a very strong connection with Barbie,” Ferrera tells Vogue.</p><p>The iconic first teaser trailer of the movie is a parody of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey where a voiceover (narrated by Helen Mirren) tells that “Since the first little girl ever existed, there have been dolls.” A bunch of girls discover the first Barbie, and Margot Robbie’s silhouette is shown wearing Barbie’s first outfit from 1959. Safe to say, we’re really stoked about this movie.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=barbie-movie-poster-memes>Barbie Movie Poster Memes</h2><p>Well if you’ve seen by now that the Barbie movie posters have generated many memes—even those that spread far beyond the Barbie Cinematic Universe.</p><p>One viral meme includes two prominent characters in Succession,&nbsp;Shiv and Kendall Roy.</p><p>Another one with drag queen Trixie Mattel, who encapsulates everything Barbie is.</p><p>An appearance from Gwyneth Paltrow herself, who recently won her infamous ski court case.</p><p>STYLECASTER also made one with the Internet’s Daddy Pedro Pescal.</p><p>And…with Barbie’s box office competitor Oppenheimer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ShoppingNewsletter_onsitegraphic.png><p><span class=s1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
