But for the rest of us living in this reality, Swift is an omnipresent figure in the music world - and beyond. With her catchy tunes and relatable lyrics, she's gained a global fanbase, scored numerous chart-topping hits, and won a boatload of awards. But what we're really here to talk about today are her songs about friendship. Yes, friendship. While the media tends to fixate on Swift's songs about love and heartbreak (we're looking at you, "All Too Well"), her lyrics on the theme of friendship deserve a bit more airtime.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-104 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Let's start at the beginning, with "Fifteen," a track from Swift's 2008 album "Fearless." The lyric we're focusing on goes: "And when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you / You're gonna believe them / And when you're fifteen don't forget to look before you fall / I've found time can heal most anything / And you just might find who you're supposed to be." This song is not about some grand, sweeping saga of friendship, but it's rather a picture of that sweet, innocent time when your best friend was the most important person in the world. It's about the kind of friendship that forms in the crucible of adolescence, when you're still figuring out who you are and who you want to be.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-105 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>It's clear in this lyric that Swift is reflecting on her younger self and those early friendships. She acknowledges the intensity of emotions at that age, the vulnerability, the tendency to fall in love too easily, and the journey of self-discovery. It's a poignant look back at a time when friendships were less about utility and more about shared experiences and mutual growth. And isn't that something we all can relate to?<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-106 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Swift's song "22," from her 2012 album "Red," captures a very different stage of life. The selected lyric, "We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time / It's miserable and magical," is a masterful encapsulation of the turmoil and ecstasy of young adulthood. You're free and independent, yet you're also terrified because you're supposed to be an adult now. And in the midst of this chaos, your friends are your lifeline.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-107 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Swift's portrayal of friendship at this stage is one of joy, freedom, and shared confusion. It's no longer just about shared history; it's about shared experiences in the present. It's about navigating this tumultuous period of life together, about being there for each other through the highs and lows, the victories and disappointments. Swift's lyric captures the paradoxical emotions of young adulthood, and the essential role of friendships in making sense of it all.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-108 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Moving forward chronologically, we land on "New Year's Day," a track from Swift's 2017 album "Reputation." The lyric, "I want your midnights / But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day," is a departure from the carefree vibes of "22." This is a song about commitment and longevity, about sticking with your friends even when the party's over and all that's left is the mess.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-109 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>It's a mature understanding of friendship, acknowledging that true companionship is not just about sharing the good times but also about weathering the storm together. It's about being there for each other in the sobering light of day, when the excitement has died down and reality has set in.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-110 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Swift's portrayal of friendship in this song is both poignant and realistic. It's an appreciation of those friends who stick around when things get tough, who help you clean up the mess (literally and figuratively), who are there for the mundane moments as well as the extraordinary ones. It's a departure from the idealized friendships of youth, showing instead a deeper, more resilient bond that withstands the test of time.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-111 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Last but not least, we have "No Body, No Crime" from Swift's 2020 album "Evermore." The lyric, "Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen / And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene," is a far cry from the innocence of "Fifteen" and the joy of "22." This is a song about loyalty and solidarity, about going to extreme lengths for a friend.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Swift's lyric paints a picture of a friendship so strong that it's willing to cross legal boundaries. While we certainly don't endorse crime, it's hard not to appreciate the sentiment behind it. It's about standing up for your friends, about seeking justice on their behalf, about loyalty that knows no bounds. It's a testament to the lengths one might go for a friend, showcasing the fierce, protective side of friendship.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-113 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>So there you have it: a journey through Taylor Swift's discography, as seen through the lens of friendship. From the innocence of adolescence to the joy of young adulthood, from the commitment of true friendship to the fierce loyalty of an unwavering bond, Swift's lyrics capture the many facets of this beautiful relationship. And isn't that something worth singing about?<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>From the album "Folklore," we have "Seven." The lyric, "And though I can’t recall your face / I still got love for you / Your braids like a pattern / Love you to the Moon and to Saturn," is a sentimental reminiscence of a childhood friendship. This is not the Taylor of "Fifteen," new to the world and trying to figure it all out. Nor is it the Taylor of "22," navigating the complexities of young adulthood. This is Swift as the wistful adult, looking back on a friendship from her earliest years, and it's beautiful in its own way.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>The lyric is about a friendship that's deeply rooted in her past, one that predates fame and all the trappings of adulthood. It's a bond that, while perhaps faded with time, still holds a special place in her heart. It's a friendship that has survived in memory and feeling, if not in the day-to-day. It's a testament to those childhood friendships that leave a lasting imprint, reminding us of where we came from and who we once were.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>So, what can we glean from these lyrics? Well, for one, Swift's songs about friendship span a wide emotional and experiential spectrum. They capture the innocence of early friendships ("Fifteen"), the joy and shared confusion of young adulthood ("22"), the commitment and longevity of enduring bonds ("New Year's Day"), the fierce loyalty and solidarity in friendship ("No Body, No Crime"), and the deep nostalgia of childhood friendships ("Seven").</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>Swift's lyrics reveal that friendships, like life, are not static. They evolve and shift over time, reflecting our growth and changing circumstances. But, while the shape of these relationships may change, their significance remains. Friends are our confidants, our cheerleaders, our partners in crime. They share our joys, lighten our burdens, and enrich our lives in countless ways. And isn't that worth singing about?</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>In the end, the power of Swift's lyrics lies not just in their catchy tunes or their relatability, but in their ability to capture the nuances of human experiences - including friendships. They offer a window into different stages of life, different types of relationships, different facets of friendship. They remind us that, while friendships may change and evolve over time, their value remains constant.</p><p style=white-space:pre-wrap>So, whether you're fifteen or twenty-two, whether you're cleaning up bottles on New Year's Day or navigating the complexities of life, remember to cherish your friendships. Because, as Swift's lyrics remind us, these bonds are not just a part of our lives - they help define them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyjuM6gZq2glWKvpr%2FTZquasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWcrr%2Bqr9JmmJunpal6p77InqWdq5ievQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ted-nugent-wife-daughter-family-net-worth-wiki-dead-or-alive.html><span>←</span><span>Ted Nugent Wife, Daughter, Family, Net Worth, Wiki, Dead or Alive?</span></a>
