Throughout the song, there are multiple standout lyrics that help develop various themes that tie back to this overarching sense of power.One of the standout lyrics is, "Ever since my brother died, I've been thinking 'bout homicide." This line, despite its dark connotation, speaks to the theme of seeking retribution and taking matters into one's own hands.

This theme reflects a desire for control over one's personal relationships and a refusal to tolerate any perceived betrayal. It adds to the overarching theme of power and dominance within the song.The line, "I'm too shiesty, I ain't got no OG," delves into the theme of self-reliance and resourcefulness. It suggests a lack of guidance or mentorship, but highlights the artist's ability to navigate their circumstances independently. This theme emphasizes the idea that true strength comes from within and that relying on oneself is a key to asserting power and control.Lastly, the lyric, "If Rick don't cut you a check, you better sue," delves into the theme of financial independence and self-worth. It suggests a refusal to settle for less and the determination to demand what one believes they deserve. This theme explores the idea that financial success is a symbol of power and autonomy, and that asserting one's value is an important part of maintaining control.Overall, "Stop Breathing" by Playboi Carti communicates a theme of power, control, and dominance.
