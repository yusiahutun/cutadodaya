That independence grew even more due to the passage of the Statute of Westminster (an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom) in 1931. Canada soon became completely independent with the passing of the Constitution Act, 1982. This was when Dominion Day became Canada Day.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-5>Canada Day can happen on 2nd July.</h2><p>Although the National Day of Canada occurs as a statutory holiday every 1st July, if the holiday falls on a weekend, it will legally transpire on July 2nd. Nonetheless, events will usually continue to take place on 1st July, in spite that it’s not a legal holiday.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-6>The three British colonies became Canada.</h2><p>In an overview, Canada Day honors and rejoices the anniversary of the Constitution Act (signed on July 1, 1867). Furthermore, it remembers the day the three British colonies of the Province of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick were united to form a single country.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-7>Initially, most Canadians did not widely celebrate Dominion Day.</h2><p>Initially, most Canadians did not widely celebrate nor didn’t really care that much about Dominion Day as they still view themselves to be British. All of these have changed after renaming Dominion Day to Canada Day 100 years later. The change of name became a subject of debate because the people wanted to continue using ‘Dominion Day’ as the name of the holiday though it was ‘Canada Day’ that prevailed in the end.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-8>The Royal Family continues its appreciation for Canada Day.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/canada-day-730x487.jpg><p>Queen Elizabeth II has visited the country numerous times to celebrate this holiday.

Moving Day is a tradition practised in Quebec. This tradition came about from the 18th century where the province used to mandate fixed terms for the leases of rented properties. Moving Day used to fall on 1st May, until the government decided to change the date to 1st July due to the unstable <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# title=weather data-wpil-keyword-link=linked data-wpel-link=internal>weather</a> in May. July became the better choice as it was during summer.</p><p>On Moving Day, logistic companies are extremely busy serving countless Canadians in Quebec—in Montreal for instance, 55% of its people own a house making it the lowest in all major Canadian cities. Described as “a kind of moving madness,” logistic companies work non stop in this season, (charges often being twice to thrice the normal rate) and has inspired many entrepreneurs to make a business out of it. Friends are usually looped in to assist with the moving, thus making Moving Day more like a community bonding event.</p><p>Read also: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><span>September 26th All Facts Events That Happened Today In History</span></a></p><h2 class=content-title id=title-10>"O Canada" became the official national anthem on July 1, 1980.</h2><p>The national anthem of the country, “O Canada” became the official national anthem on 1st July or the same date as Canada Day. Proclaimed in the year 1980, Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, Théodore Robitaille originally commissioned “O Canada” for the 1880 Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony. The song has a pleasant and peaceful hymn that will make even a non-Canadian adore it—truly one of the best national anthems in the world.</p><p></p><p>This article belongs to <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Facts.net</a> and may not be reproduced, copied, edited, published, transmitted, or uploaded in any way without the permission of Facts.net.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-11>It's not uncommon to celebrate Canada Day with beer.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mark-de-jong-k2dXO7fkZF4-unsplash.jpg><p>In contrast to the closure of liquor stores during Canada Day, according to a report, Canadians love to gulp <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>beer</a> privately and socially on this holiday coming from their “reserved liquors.” Based on estimates, more than 500 thousand liters of beer are consumed over the country’s birthday. Canada ranks number 32 in the world with most beer consumption, approximately 55.7 liters per capita.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-12>Churches, military, and civilians joined the first Confederation.</h2><p>Known today as Constitution Act, 1867 or the British North America Act, 1867’s enactment confederated the country for the first time on July 1, 1867.

Since its first celebration in 1867, it took more than 10 years or until May 15, 1879, when it was designated as a statutory holiday and fully recognized the country as a whole.

This event sparked every Canadian to participate in Dominion Day every year.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-18>It was first seen on national television in the 1960s.</h2><p>During the 60s, media and national television featured Dominion Day including its cultural concerts which made it even more special. Around the 1980s, the Canadian government introduced Canada’s celebration of Dominion Day beyond the national capital, giving gifts and assistance to numerous cities across Canada as well as helping to fund their local activities.</p><h2 class=content-title id=title-19>Many Canadians were already calling the holiday Canada Day before 1982.</h2><p>The renaming of Dominion Day to Canada Day occurred in 1982. But interestingly, many Canadians were already calling the holiday Canada Day. That practice resulted in some controversies thus the other party wants to continue Dominion Day while others believed that the word Dominion was widely misunderstood.
