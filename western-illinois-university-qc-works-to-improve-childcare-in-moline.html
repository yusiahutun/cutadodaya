Mayor Sangeetha Rayapati and her staff have been working to help increase the availability of childcare in Moline.</p><p>The grant will finance a nature-based outdoor play and learning area that is adaptable for blended age groups. The proposed play areas include an outdoor art station, mud kitchen and tricycle track. The play and learning area will be used for center-related family events, with time available for the public to use outside of the center’s operating hours.</p><p>“Outdoor play and learning is an essential part of child development, enhancing self-regulation, creative problem solving, language skills and so much more,” said Director of the Center for Best Practices in Early Childhood Education Lindsay Meeker. “Free play outdoors and connecting with nature lights up parts of our brains that cannot be accomplished any other way. The grant from The City of Moline makes it possible for our Bilingual Early Learning Lab Site and childcare to give children those experiences. It is planned as a nature scape play area and outdoor classroom, including a child-led garden area.”</p><p>Rocky’s Play Space is expected to open this spring at 406 Seventh Street in Moline. The program will have a minimum of 65 children across operating shifts, with priority enrollment of 70% to linguistically diverse families and those experiencing vulnerabilities. Both enrolled and non-enrolled families can access wrap-around and family education services.</p><p>WIU is also working with the United Way to offer learning academies for local families with young children, along with the Moline and East Moline Parent Mentor Program. Students in the College of Education and Human Services will be able to gain hands-on experiences through family education opportunities and working directly with children and early childhood advocacy groups that will prepare them for industry-based careers after graduation.</p><p>The ARPA Childcare/Workforce Infrastructure Forgivable Loan Program works to help families and Moline businesses that have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The program supports childcare and early education workforce development, as well as strengthening existing centers.</p><p>For more information on the College of Education and Human Services (COEHS), click <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaK6eq6Sav695yKWjoqafnsBuwc2irZ6qo57BunnQnGSwp6KgwG7AzmagpqiipMOmecKhoKWck5a%2FpnnIp2Smp5yeu6Z7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ohio-mom-charged-killing-daughter-home-dumping-body-field-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ohio mom 'suffocated daughter and then dumped her body in a field'</span></a>
