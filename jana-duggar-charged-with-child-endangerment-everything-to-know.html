In addition to her twin brother, <strong>John-David</strong>, she has 17 siblings: <a href=#><strong>Josh, Jill, Jessa, Jinger, Joseph, Josiah, Joy-Anna, Jedidiah, Jeremiah, Jason, James, Justin, Jackson, Johannah, Jennifer, Jordyn-Grace </strong></a>and<a href=#><strong> Josie.</strong></a></p><p>While she may be the second oldest in a family that tends to get married young, Jana is single.</p><p>“I feel like these days, probably one of the most common questions is, ‘Am I in a relationship?’” she said during a September 2020 episode of their former reality show. “Sometimes it gets a little old. I’m like ‘No, I’m not, no I don’t have anyone.’ And usually, I’m just like ‘OK, I’ll just answer it and go on and that’s it.’ Sometimes it can get a little like, ‘What, that’s not the only thing in the world to talk about.'”</p><p>She added at the time: “Most of my siblings have gotten married really young. Some people are like, ‘Are you picky?’ I’m like, ‘I don’t think so.'”</p><p>TLC officially cut ties with the Duggars after Josh, who no longer <a href=#>appeared on Counting On,</a> was arrested for possession of child pornography in June 2021. (He was found guilty in December 2021 and is awaiting sentencing.) That <a href=#>doesn’t stop the famous family</a> from making headlines, however, as Jana <a href=#>came under fire amid Josh’s trial</a>. The same month that Josh was convicted, news broke that Jana was facing child endangerment allegations<a href=#> related to an incident three months prior.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I was babysitting a few months ago when one of the children wandered outside alone,” Jana said via a social media statement. “A passerby who saw the child called the police. This resulted in a written citation, as well as a follow-up with child welfare who concluded that it was an accident and the child was unharmed.”</p><p>Scroll through for more on Jana’s case:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6K6wGabrp%2BXlr9ur8eaqaCdlGLEqsDHZpqhoZyZeqa6w5qloJ2iorKvwIyerZ6qqam1qrrGZquoZZujvLh7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-chinese-scientists-just-bring-down-unmanned-plane.html><span>←</span><span>Did Chinese scientists just bring down an unmanned plane with an electromagnetic pulse weapon?</span></a>
