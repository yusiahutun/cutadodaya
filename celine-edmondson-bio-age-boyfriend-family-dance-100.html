She was able to breeze through the first two levels, but the third level was a different story.</p><p>She had to compete in a dance-off with Janick Arseneau since she received one of the two lowest numbers of votes out of the remaining four candidates. The former, however, staged a charming return and impressed more than half of the judges’ dancers to go to the semifinals.</p><p>Celine had to create two routines for a total of 25 dancers in order to be ready for the competition’s penultimate round. She had to pay respect to the 2000s for the opening performance. The performer made sure that the intensity we all associate with this particular era of dancing was there on stage by assigning a song in advance.</p><p>Celine was a child of the 1990s, so she was quite familiar with the time period. Yet, given that she was now a semifinalist, her performance did leave the audience wanting more.</p><p>The time had come for Celine and her team to graphically represent a narrative based on the concept of escaping the confines of the status quo. She obviously felt passionate about this issue, therefore the dancer chose to write a story about regular factory workers who decide to live their lives as they like after escaping from their routines.</p><p>Many people undoubtedly found the use of color to represent the change to be effective. The performance, according to several of the judges, should have been improved. Ultimately, Celine was regrettably unable to go to the finals. But, she did win a ton of fans as a result of the show’s outstanding performance.</p><h3><strong>Celine Edmondson Career</strong></h3><p>Celine Edmondson aka Boom started her dancing career at the age of 12.
