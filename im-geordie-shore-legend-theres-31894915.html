Other stars who haven't returned for the latest series include Bethan Kershaw and Vicky Pattison.</p><p>Opening up about what fans can expected from the latest show, James explained: "It's definitely different now kids are involved. There is drama but there's also so many good moments and really heartfelt touching moments that us to be a part of together and see was unreal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article31825675.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_EXCL-Geordie-Shore-house-knocked-down-turned-into-rubble-leaving-MTV-stars-heartbroken.jpg><p>"When we get together now we really appreciate it. We all have a lot of love for each other. Geordie Shore for us has played a monumental part of our lives and I think the fact it's still going now we're grateful for it. We don't often see each other so any chance we get for us all to get back together and go on holiday somewhere it's a no brainer."</p><p>James will introduce his girlfriend Leah to fans this series as she plan to make a life-changing decision. He said: "I had a lot going on going into this series. I've got a new girlfriend, we've been together like a year, so she came into the series and got to meet everyone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b>Join the Daily Star Soaps WhatsApp for all the latest spoilers and exclusives</b></a></p><p>"She had only met a couple of people outside of it so coming in and meeting everyone went really well. I think it shows how much we've all grown up. It couldn't have gone better so I was glad to bring her in and show me in a relationship again. We live in Dubai now so we were getting ready to go and move over there at the end of filming. We had big parties and told people for the first time because I managed to keep it a secret which was hard, so that's all on the show too."</p><p><b>Watch the brand new series of Geordie Shore on Paramount+ first or catch-up weekly on MTV.
