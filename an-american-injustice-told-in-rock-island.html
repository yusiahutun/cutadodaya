Their story is one of resilience, determination, and the pursuit of justice – a narrative that deserves to be heard, the release says.</p><p>Not long after America entered World War II, the U.S. Army began looking for land along the Georgia coast on which to build an Army airfield.&nbsp;In McIntosh County, the Army was led to Harris Neck by a few local power brokers, and the federal government took Harris Neck via eminent domain and gave the community just a few weeks to move, according to the Harris Neck Land Trust.</p><p>On July 27, 1942, everyone was evicted, some forcefully; the Army then burned and bulldozed everything in the community and began construction of its airfield.&nbsp;The people of Harris Neck were all left homeless, and every person’s livelihood was destroyed in a single day, the land trust website says.&nbsp;This taking was the first in a long series of injustices that the people of Harris Neck have endured up to the present day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2023/08/Harris4.png><p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href=#>established Harris Neck National Wildlife Refuge</a> on the former Army airfield in 1962. &nbsp;</p><p>For more information on the documentary, visit the <a href=#>Harris Neck Land Trust website HERE</a> or the <a href=#>Harris Neck community site HERE</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJirrKNirq%2BwjJyspaylp7Jwrc1mmKadop6worqMoqWjraOptqSxjK2mpZxdnrtuvs6comaho6Gur7CO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rare-unique-seeds.html><span>←</span><span>13 of the Coolest Seeds You Can Buy Online Unique Plants and Vegetables</span></a>
