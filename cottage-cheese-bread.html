But cottage cheese bread? You bet! It ups the protein, lowers the carbs and makes for a delicious slice you can use for toast, sandwiches and more. Keep reading to learn the benefits of baking with cottage cheese, get a simple 2-ingredient cottage cheese bread recipe and see our favorite ways to enjoy it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The ingredients in cottage cheese bread</h2><p>Many recipes for this bread combine cottage cheese with other ingredients like almond flour and eggs to form a batter. You can also simply mix cottage cheese with powdered egg whites for a super-quick version. The cottage cheese acts as a binding agent to help everything come together in dough form. Afterward, the mixture is baked in a loaf pan until it’s golden brown on top and the center is tender.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How cottage cheese bread differs from other breads</h2><p>Cottage cheese isn’t the first bread-baking ingredient that comes to mind. But it’s a great binding agent that holds the dough together similar to butter and even all-purpose flour. The end result is cheese-based bread with a soft and springy texture and slightly tangy flavor compared to commercial white breads.</p><p>Along with its unique taste, cottage cheese bread has a nutritional advantage over other kinds. The average slice of cottage cheese bread contains <a href=# rel=noopener>135 calories, 1 gram of saturated fat, 23 grams of carbs and 6 grams of protein</a>. This is significantly better than the <a href=# rel=noopener>157 calories, 27 grams of carbs, 3 grams of saturated fat and 4 grams of protein</a> found in a slice of homemade white bread. (Click through to learn how <a href=#>cottage cheese protein can help you lose weight</a> effortlessly and how protein can ward off an <a href=# rel=noopener>afternoon slump</a>.)</p><p>How does this happen? Well, <a href=# rel=noopener>Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDCES, LDN, CPT</a>, registered dietitian and author of <a href=# rel=noopener>Belly Fat Diet For Dummies</a>,&nbsp;shares three ways that cottage cheese creates a healthier and tastier loaf of bread.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. It reduces the bread’s saturated fat content.</h3><p>Palinski-Wade notes that cottage cheese tames the bread’s saturated fat and calorie content. In fact, a ½-cup serving of this superfood contains <a href=# rel=noopener>approximately 110 calories and 3 grams of saturated fat</a>. “For those looking to cut carbs to improve blood sugar, this can be very beneficial, as diets high in saturated fat are linked with <a href=#>increased insulin resistance</a>,” she says.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>How to Make Ezekiel Bread At Home: Easy Recipe For This Super-Healthy Bread</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. It lowers the carb content.</h3><p>Although refined flour gives bread an easy-to-chew texture, it spikes its carbohydrate content. Luckily, Palinski-Wade says you swap these flours for cottage cheese to whip up light and fluffy bread without guilt. “Using cottage cheese to make bread is an easy way to cut out refined flours to reduce the overall carbohydrate content of the bread,” she notes.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>The White Bread That’s Actually *Good* For You: Why Docs Recommend Sourdough</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. It boosts the protein content.</h3><p>According to Palinski-Wade, adding cottage cheese to the dough “boosts the protein content, allowing the bread to have less impact on blood sugar while promoting fullness.” Keep in mind that not all cottage cheese brands are created equal. That’s why she suggests using Daisy 4% Cottage Cheese (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Walmart, $3.78</a>) as it only contains three ingredients and provides a whopping 13 grams of protein per ½ cup.</p><p>These are just a few benefits of making bread using cottage cheese, and for more, click through to read our stories on the <a href=#>digestive perks of eating cottage cheese</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>how it helps kickstart fat loss</a> and <a href=#>additional ways to add it to your daily diet</a>!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to make cottage cheese bread</h2><p>For cottage bread that only needs a couple of ingredients, try this viral recipe from nutrition blogger <a href=# rel=noopener>Bethany Cameron</a>. It simply involves folding fluffy egg whites and whipped cottage cheese together before baking it in a loaf pan. The end result is a bread that’s light and airy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Yum!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Cottage Cheese Bread Made Using 2 Ingredients</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 cup powdered egg whites (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $12.47</a>)</li><li>1 cup cultured cottage cheese</li></ul><p><strong>Directions:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Active:</strong> 10 mins</li><li><strong>Total time:</strong> 40 mins + cooling time</li><li><strong>Yield:</strong> 1 loaf (around 12 slices)</li></ul><li>Preheat oven to 350°F.

However, if you don’t have it on hand, separate around 8 large eggs or enough to equal 1 cup. Omit the water, whip as normal and proceed with the recipe.</li><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Standard Cottage Cheese Bread</h3><p>Unlike traditional bread recipes, preparing cottage cheese bread doesn’t require any kneading or lengthy rise times.
