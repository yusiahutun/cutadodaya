During a recent appearance on the Kelly Clarkson Show, Stefani shared how Shelton's rugged outdoors experience helped win over her family when they first visited him at his Oklahoma ranch.</p><p>"We are from Anaheim, so we've never even seen trees before," she recalls. "We're driving, and Blake's in his truck, and there's a tree that had been blown down in the road. And Blake gets out, and he's like, 'All right,'" she shares, emulating a macho swagger as she tells the story.</p><p>"He has a big chain, he pulls it out and he wraps it around the tree and pulls it," she recounts. "My whole family's like, 'Oh my god! He's a man!'"</p><p><strong>Country Music Fans Will Love Caylee Hammack!</strong></p><p>Stefani's not the only one of Shelton's fellow <a href=#>The Voice</a> coaches to admire his outdoor skills. The other cast members were also part of the segment, and when Clarkson asked which coach they would like to have along if they were stranded in the wild, the others picked him universally. <a href=#>John Legend</a> cited how handy his outdoors experience would be, while The Voice host <a href=#>Carson Daly</a>&nbsp;gave another reason for his choice.</p><p>"I would pick Blake, and I would kill him and take the vodka in his back pocket," he quipped. "'Cause I got news for ya: You see his Starbuck's mug on The Voice, right?
