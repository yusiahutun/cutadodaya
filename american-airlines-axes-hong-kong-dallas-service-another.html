Two years later, the airline added a Los Angeles link.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The carrier has suspended some flights to Hong Kong since February last year and continued to defer the restart based on the strict Covid-19 protocols imposed on aircrew arriving in the city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Staff testing positive for the coronavirus can be sent to hospital for an indefinite period. US airline unions have vehemently objected to such confinement.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The delay in deliveries of the 787 certainly hasn’t helped, and that is causing AA to have another look at its network, and where it can deploy its long-haul aircraft most profitably,” said Henk Ombelet, head of advisory operations at aviation data company Ascend by Cirium.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The travel restrictions to Hong Kong are clearly reducing demand, and I think AA must be expecting demand not to recover for a long time, and hence it has taken the decision not to return.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to Diio by Cirium aviation data, Hong Kong airport has 1,307 flights scheduled in December, a 91 per cent reduction on the same month in 2019.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Foreign aircrew rules have since become watertight, with flight staff only allowed to go from the airport to their hotel room and they must undergo frequent testing. All recovered patients in Hong Kong must undergo two weeks of additional quarantine after their discharge.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Positive cases have previously been identified in the aircrew of British Airways, Finnair, Virgin Atlantic and a number of cargo pilots.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">British Airway, Swiss International Air Lines, Air France and Lufthansa last week temporarily suspended services. They were concerned at the threat to their operations of aircrew being confined to a government isolation camp for 21 days if positive Covid-19 tests were to emerge.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">FedEx also moved to shut down its long-standing Hong Kong pilot base last month, after relocating its crews to San Francisco earlier in the year to skirt the city’s tough quarantine rules for aircrew.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cathay Pacific, the city’s largest airline, has also struggled under the weight of the aircrew rules and Hong Kong’s dogged pursuit of zero-Covid.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong has not recorded a local Covid-19 case in months. In the wake of the Omicron coronavirus variant, health authorities have further tightened quarantine rules for 37 countries.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoq6uZnqi9sL7TaJirrJmYuaZ7kmpscmlnaXyiucSroJyZnmKuqr7LoqWeq12Wxaa%2FjKGmp59doLyvs4ydmKWkkah6tLHRr6CcnV2Wu7DAx56p</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./12-surprising-facts-about-the-cleopatra-statue.html><span>←</span><span>12 Surprising Facts About The Cleopatra Statue</span></a>
