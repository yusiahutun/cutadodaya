I mean, first, it’s sort of scary. Then you get mad."</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>tragedy</a> at Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, Calif., that took the lives of twelve people is something that was weighing heavily on Wallen's mind not only on&nbsp;this particular night, but seemingly every night&nbsp;since.</p><p>"I don’t have any answers, but in my personal opinion, I’m a person that has faith and I believe that a lot of people have neglected God," he says, his eyes&nbsp;focused on the ground beneath him. "We don’t put the Ten Commandments in school anymore. We just neglect everything and people act like the Ten Commandments is something so terrible. I mean, it’s a way to live. I think we all could agree on what they say."</p><p><strong>Watch Morgan Wallen's "Whiskey Glasses" for RISERS</strong></p><p>He takes a deep breath before he continues.</p><p>“I believe in God," he explains.&nbsp;"I believe that He’s real and I believe He has control over a lot of things and I think throughout history there has been a lot of countries that have turned their back on Him and the result is not great. Hopefully, we can get something figured out."</p><p>Wallen&nbsp;is anguished knowing that some of the people who lost their lives at Borderline were some of the same country music fans&nbsp;who were <a href=#>spared</a> at the <a href=#>Route 91 Music Festival shooting</a> last October. "No one should have to go through that once, and definitely not twice," he says, speaking a little quieter. "I guess it’s just the reality of the world we live in."</p><p>Wallen — the latest Taste of Country RISERS rising star — recently claimed his first&nbsp;No. 1 single for his hit "<a href=#>Up Down</a>"&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href=#>Florida Georgia Line</a>.</p><p><strong>Remember the Borderline Bar and Grill Shooting Victims:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpqeinK6vedaao6WdnmLAqbvOraCnn6NiubC%2F02apnqSZnLawuo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./474942-ll-continue-praising-god-sda-choir-unleashing-killer-dance-moves-streets-shut-critics.html><span>←</span><span>&amp;quot;We'll Continue Praising God&amp;quot;: SDA Choir Unleashing Killer Dance Moves on Streets Shuts Down Critics</span></a>
