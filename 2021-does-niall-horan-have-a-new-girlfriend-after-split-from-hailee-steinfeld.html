<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Does Niall Horan Have A New Girlfriend After Split From Hailee Steinfeld?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Since Niall Horan was at the center of the resurgence of boy bands in the western world with the group, One Direction, he has become one of the most prominent names among male singers in the music industry, particularly in the west. As well as being a member of the successful group, he is also a successful solo artist, all of which has made Niall Horan’s life, specifically his dating life a subject of interest to his fans all over the globe.</p><p>Between 2017 and 2018, his storied dating life featured a new character, Hailee Steinfeld. Since the relationship came to a disappointing end, fans have wondered who will become the next girlfriend of the Slow Hands singer. In this article, we answer that question along with other details about the Irish musician.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-niall-horan-have-a-new-girlfriend></span><strong>Does Niall Horan Have a New Girlfriend?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As explained by Ted in an episode of How I Met Your Mother, winning the break up is a crucial aspect of the moving on process. Since Niall Horan and Hailee Steinfeld broke up, it would appear Niall Horan is winning.</p><p>Although nothing has yet been confirmed, Niall Horan, since his high-profile relationship with the Pitch Perfect actress, came to an end, has been linked with Selena Gomez.</p><p>In a photo that was posted on Instagram in October 2019 by Courtney Lopez, Niall Horan was with Selena Gomez and a couple of friends, in what many believed to be a group date. Two days after the photo was posted, Selena fueled the rumors when she gave the singer’s single, Nice to Meet Ya, a promotion on her Instagram page.</p><p>As at the writing of this article, nothing has been confirmed by either party. However, if it does turn out to be nothing, it would not be the first time the two of them were linked together. They were first linked together in 2015 when they were spotted on a date night watching the singer, Lewis Capaldi.</p><p>Since the first time when Selena Gomez was rumored to be the girlfriend of Niall Horan, fans excitedly loved the pairing. And even after it turned out to be a false alarm, they have remained hopeful of a relationship between the two. If the recent sightings are anything to go by, that wish may finally be coming true.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-with-hailee-steinfeld></span><strong>What Happened with Hailee Steinfeld?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>For all intent and purposes, when news of Niall Horan and Hailee Steinfeld dating hit the airwaves, it was a Hollywood relationship met with fanfare by fans of both celebrities. Niall is a music idol with millions of fans across the globe, while Hailee is a growing Hollywood superstar who has an Oscar and Golden Globe award nomination to her name already.</p><p>According to the stories out of their respective camps, Niall Horan wanted a serious relationship because he was utterly captivated by the actress, but Hailee wanted something casual and fun instead. While that difference in expectations did not bring an end to their budding relationship, Hailee’s growing schedule ultimately brought an end to their relationship.</p><p>Despite a supposed shade by Hailee Steinfeld at Niall Horan on Instagram after their relationship ended, the two of them ended on a good note and continue to have love for each other.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-else-has-he-dated></span><strong>Who Else Has He Dated?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Aside from his high-profile relationship with Hailee Steinfeld, Niall Horan has had some notable girlfriends since he became one of the music industry’s most recognizable artists.</p><p>He was in a relationship with Holly Scally, who was described as his childhood sweetheart back in 2010. The two of them eventually went their separate ways after he made his debut on The X Factor.</p><p>Niall Horan has also never been afraid to punch above his weight, or more specifically, his age when he was linked to Ellie Goulding, who is eight years older than the former One Direction singer. Their brief relationship, or more specifically, affair, reportedly inspired the song, Don’t by Ed Sheeran. Apparently, at the time, Ellie and Ed were in a relationship.</p><p>Others include the Victoria Secret Model, Barbara Palvin, who became Niall Horan’s girlfriend in 2014. It was an on-and-off relationship that ultimately died for the same reason his relationship with Hailee Steinfeld did – work. Other names in Niall’s storied dating history include Melissa Whitelaw, Jessica Serfaty, Celine Helene Vandycke, Amy Green, and a couple of others.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaGpgZ35usM6eqmammZa5rXnHqKmapl2drrexjJpkp52nYrSqvsufqaKdnpl6orLTnqlmq6ChtrV5xaumpmWYlratscRmqq2dmaOzprjDaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-perfect-festival-outfit-for-every-summer-concert-vibe.html><span>←</span><span>The Perfect Festival Outfit For Every Summer Concert Vibe</span></a>
