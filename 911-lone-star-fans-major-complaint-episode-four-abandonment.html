Praising the storyline, one fan wrote: "Rafa and Ronen acted there asses off In that episode! Literally so amazing," while another person added: "#911LoneStar would’ve benefited from focusing on just the Carlos storyline but we still got a strong ep. @RonenRubinstein & #RafaelSilva both gave incredible performances. Some beautiful #Tarlos lines in this ep. Bonita Friedericy did an amazing job as Trudie."</p><p id=eD7t78CV6BOK data-wc=15></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
