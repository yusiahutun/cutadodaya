Carlton was known for being the preppy opposite of Will — and for his signature dance moves. Specifically, the “Carlton Dance,” which he performed when he listened to the Tom Jones hit “It’s Not Unusual.” Audiences went wild whenever he did it on the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">show</a>. But Ribeiro won’t perform it anymore.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-alfonso-ribeiro-performed-the-carlton-dance-on-the-fresh-prince-of-bel-air>Alfonso Ribeiro performed the Carlton Dance on ‘The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/carlton-dance.jpg><p id=par-2_58>Actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alfonso Ribeiro</a>&nbsp;began portraying Carlton Banks when&nbsp;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&nbsp;premiered in 1990. Carlton is Will’s closest-in-age cousin, and the two begin to spend a lot of time together. They’re completely different, and much of the show’s humor comes from the two actors playing off one another, showcasing how the straight-laced Carlton guides his mischievous cousin (and vice-versa).&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_60>Fans came to love Carlton (and Ribeiro). But few things stand out quite as much as his famous dance.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fandom</a>&nbsp;notes the dance, which first came about in&nbsp;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&nbsp;Season 2, was inspired by two others:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Courteney Cox’s infamous moves</a>&nbsp;in Bruce Springsteen’s “Dancing With the Dark” music video and Eddie Murphy’s “White Man Dance” from his 1987 comedy special&nbsp;Eddie Murphy Raw.</p><p id=par-4_47>Ribeiro performed the dance several times on the show, including in the series finale, with Smith by his side. Naturally, when&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ribeiro appeared on&nbsp;Dancing with the Stars</a>, he couldn’t avoid it. He showcased his classic moves in all their glory, leading to a perfect score from the judges.</p><h2 id=h-what-has-ribeiro-said-about-the-famous-dance>What has Ribeiro said about the famous dance?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_37>Dancing with the Stars&nbsp;was a special occasion. When Ribeiro meets fans, he won’t perform the Carlton Dance, even though many ask him. In May 2022, he appeared on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jimmy Kimmel Live</a>, expressing how he doesn’t enjoy the request.</p><p id=par-6_63>“What makes you think that you just gonna ask a random person to dance for you, and they’re gonna be like, ‘Oh my God, I’ve been waiting for you to ask! Hold on a second, let me get into character,'” Ribeiro explained. “It’s not — I don’t get it. It’s not gonna happen.” Interestingly,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>&nbsp;reports that Ribeiro once tried to copyright the moves.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-is-the-actor-up-to-now>What is the actor up to now?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_70>Though it remains his biggest role to date, Ribeiro’s career certainly didn’t end when&nbsp;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&nbsp;did. These days, he’s better known as a host, having worked with the Game Show Network for several years. Ribeiro currently hosts the revival of&nbsp;America’s Funniest Home Videos, as well as the spinoff&nbsp;Animal Edition. He’s continued to act here and there, primarily in voice roles. Additionally, Ribeiro has tried his hand at directing.</p><p id=par-8_56>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&nbsp;celebrated 30 years since its premiere with a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reunion special</a>, which hit HBO Max in November 2020. Naturally, Ribeiro was in attendance to reflect on the role that made him famous. But while he was happy to celebrate with his former castmates, he stuck to his word, and didn’t do the Carlton Dance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSurbLOp6qoZaKer6a10ahkrJmpqHqkrdGlq6imXZmur6%2FEZqCsZZ6kwW6zzqelmmWYlr2xsc1nn62lnGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./13-captivating-facts-about-olde-english-bulldogge.html><span>←</span><span>13 Captivating Facts About Olde English Bulldogge</span></a>
