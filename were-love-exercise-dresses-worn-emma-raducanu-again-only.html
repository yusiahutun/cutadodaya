If you are mostly wearing them to go for an easy hike followed by brunch, go for a softer style in a technical knit with a ribbed high waistband.</p>If you are using your dress the way nature intended, i.e. for actual exercise, then think about extra details like compression (which increases circulation to reduce fatigue), moisture wicking (gets rid of sweat) and heat control (lowers the surface temperature of your skin <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">by five degrees Celsius</span></a>).Cult LA brand Alo Yoga has wonderfully comfortable designs that feel like a baby’s sleep suit but look good enough to wear out for lunch. ​​Other brands include Outdoor Voices, Girlfriend Collective, Reformation and Halara – all of which have a cult following on Instagram and <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">TikTok</span></a>, the place where this trend was born.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/19/9f0c9f8f-ad29-4517-bef3-591fc161de05_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Brands are only now catching up with just how powerful viral social media trends can be in fashion terms, and while the ease and versatility of an exercise dress are key selling points, their current cool factor cannot be underestimated.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While most people spotted in these dresses tend to be Gen Z-ers and millennials, the brands marketing them emphasise that they are designed for women of all ages. In a TikTok sponsored post for Halara’s dress, for instance, a woman in her 70s says the dress makes her feel “30 years younger”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/09/19/d12110e9-9b89-42ae-93a5-3ed5300e280f_b70e8aef.jpg>All this feels like an important step.
