When she left her post, Stefani filled the vacuum with her peroxide blonde coif and signature red lipstick. Stefani meets Shelton for the first time and posts a photo on Instagram. At this point, things are, theoretically, strictly professional.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2015></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2015</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shelton was still married to his ex-wife, Miranda Lambert; Stefani was still married to ex-husband, Gavin Rossdale. Shelton filed for divorce in July. Stefani follows suit, filing papers in August. She was married for 13 years, and he had been married for four.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the fall viewers are starting to see some sort of spark between the two, who are openly flirting on the show. Things got official in November when <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>E! News</a> reported that the two were seen holding hands at a Maroon 5 Halloween party in Studio City. While there wasn't an official announcement after the photos made the rounds, Shelton's rep confirmed to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>E!

Just in time for summer, the duo released "Go Ahead and Break My Heart," a tune co-written by Shelton and Stefani. It featured on Shelton's album, If I'm Honest. They performed the tune together at Billboard Awards.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Gwen saved my life," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Billboard</a>.

They found each other at really interesting times in their lives. It's really beautiful. Because it's in the public eye, a lot of people want to have their own bullshit opinions about it," he said. "But I'm, like, there. I see it every day. I have a pretty unique perspective on it, and it's real, man."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-november-2017></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>November 2017</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shelton is named People's Sexiest Man Alive.

You're so sexy!'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's Stefani's turn to have Blake make an appearance in one of her songs.

Shelton responded, "I love the rumors. Those rumors are great. Anybody that thinks that I'm married to Gwen already, I love it. My God. Who wouldn't want to be married to Gwen Stefani?"</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-february-2020></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>February 2020</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The music keeps coming.

The only thing is, nobody noticed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_84-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She kept doing this with her hand and wondering if people would figure out that she was wearing an engagement ring," Shelton said. "I told her, 'You know, you wear more jewelry than Mr. T, so I don't think people picked up on that.' And they didn't. You could have figured it out though — she was giving you hints!"</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-february-2021></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_88-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>February 2021</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_89-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The engaged couple appears in a Super Bowl ad alongside Adam Levine for T-Mobile. During the ad, Stefani is video chatting with Levine and tells him what she's looking for in a guy. "I want someone completely different. Maybe from another country," she tells Levine. But on Levin's spotty non-T-Mobile network, he hears something completely different and sets her up with Shelton. Stefani is shocked with Shelton shows up for their date.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_93-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>June 2021</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_94-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gwen and Blake may have secretly tied the knot. In <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>photos</a> obtained by The Post, the couple was spotted at the park in Santa Monica, California with one of Gwen's sons, and one incriminating piece of jewelry has the internet thinking they've already gotten married. The No Doubt singer was wearing a sparkling wedding band alongside her emerald-cut engagement ring. The Voice coaches were recently spending time on Blake's ranch in Oklahoma, which has a chapel built on the grounds that a source said the couple planned to use for the wedding. Further convincing everyone of their secret nuptials is a post that Gwen shared to her Instagram on Friday, which showed her drinking wine and holding a present with the words, “SHE’S GETTING MARRIIIEEEED” at the top of the photo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeSoa6ssYysn56kpKS7brPWnqVmq6Sas6K6yGapnqSRqbawutKhoKllpJ66prjIp5w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./audrey-hamilton.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Audrey Hamilton dating?
