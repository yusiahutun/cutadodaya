Terms of the deal were not yet known for Smith, the decorated lineman who will take on the job of protecting Aaron Rodgers' blind side in 2024. Smith, 33, is a five-time All-Pro selection -- two first-team and three second-team choices, including a second-team nod in 2023. He has been voted to eight Pro Bowls since taking over the Cowboys' left tackle job. Smith has not played more than 13 games in a single regular season since 2015 due to injuries. He played in just two in 2020 (neck surgery), 11 in 2021 (ankle injuries) and four in 2022 (torn hamstring). The Jets, who ranked tied for 29th in sacks allowed (64) last year, have remade their offensive line in the first week of this offseason. After releasing guard Laken Tomlinson, New York signed free agent guard John Simpson, who started all 17 games for the Baltimore Ravens in 2023. Then they acquired right tackle Morgan Moses from Baltimore in exchange for a fourth-round pick swap and a sixth-rounder. Moses spent one season with the Jets in 2021. --Field Level Media</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKugpL%2B1v46nmK2hn6OurXvRnqeoqqSoequx06xkrKGXo3qnu9GmnKtlk6TEo7vYrGSlrF2pxrO7zWaqpqGknXyivtOimqWdj5h%2FdHyWmmpqZWeasHJ5lG%2Baa2Voa39xecWemZ2aZpeGeX3CamWhrJ2h</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shazam-fury-of-the-gods-one-of-the-worst-dc-movies-ever.html><span>←</span><span>One of the Worst DC Movies Ever</span></a>
