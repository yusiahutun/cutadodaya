The brothers talk about their youth and Travis’ obsession with <a href=#>Justin Timberlake’s</a> hair, as well as the controversy surrounding <a href=#>Travis’ fade after it was claimed he “invented” it</a>. Jason, 36, teased his brother about wanting to change up his look, but there is a possibility he could’ve been inspired by a music star.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-wanted-his-hair-to-be-like-justin-timberlake-s>Travis Kelce ‘wanted his hair to be like Justin Timberlake’s’</h2><p>On the latest episode, which was released yesterday (February 8) Travis Kelce discussed how <a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a> inspired him in his choice of haircut during the 90s.</p><p>However, Jason pointed out it could’ve been <a href=#>Eminem</a>, considering the 34-year-old had wanted to dye it bleach blonde.</p><p>Travis said “It happens more than you think” when it comes to children and teens wanting to look like their favorite <a href=#>celebrities</a> and reeled off some examples.</p><p>“Last year, I remember [the] Bryce Harper haircut was popular. The Pay Mahomes has been popular in Kansas City amongst the kids for years.”</p><p>“What is the Pat Mahomes?” asked Jason. “It’s like a fro-hawk,” Travis responded. “But it goes all the way down?” Jason asked and Travis clarified it does.</p><p>“I mean, I remember when we were kids and I wanted my hair blond like Eminem,” Travis reminisced. “So mom got the spray on [it].”</p><p>“If you stood outside long enough it turned blond,” Jason quipped, making his younger sibling chuckle. “Man, the 90s baby,” Travis said, “doesn’t get any better baby.”</p><p>Jason, however, wanted some clarity. “Was it for Eminem or was it for JT?” he asked. “It was either him or Justin Timberlake.”</p><p>“I think it was JT,” remembered Jason, “JT had the sun and Eminem was like a straight bleach right?’ Travis responded: “I don’t know,” while laughing. “Alright, me neither,” conceded Jason.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-controversial-fade>Travis’ controversial fade</h2><p>In the same episode about his JT-inspired haircut, Travis reaffirmed he was not happy a New York Times article had credited him with “inventing” the fade and had begun calling it “the Travis Kelce.”</p><p>He called it ridiculous and pointed out the fact the article had been published on the first of Black History Month.</p><p><a href=#>Taylor Swift’s</a> beau said at a press conference: “It’s ridiculous. I got a good fade if you need it, though. It’s a two on top and a nice high-to-mid fade with a taper in the back. I didn’t invent that. I just asked for it.</p><p>“They throw me into the wolves like that,” Kelce joked.</p><p>“That was messed up, man. I don’t want anything to do with that one, man.”</p><p>On the podcast, he added: “Thanks for whoever wrote this article,” Travis said while not looking best pleased.</p><p>“I had more barbers attack me for not even having anything to do with it! Like I didn’t want anything to do with this.”</p><p>“What better month to credit a white man with inventing the fade than February,” Jason said dryly.</p><p>“On the first [of Black History Month], too. I didn’t want anything to do with this,” Travis repeated, “I saw this, and I said, ‘No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This isn’t real. This isn’t true.”</p><p>However, he did conclude: “I didn’t invent the fade, but I know where you can get a good one.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WGcMXOrqWgZaSnrre10mainqSTmnq0vNGasJ6cXZ22tHnHmqCrZZKasKLB0p5koZ1drK6vwMSdZK2nXaG8sLeMpaCknV2fwrTAyKdkraGdl7KzuMCknGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bettye-witt.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Bettye Witt dating?
