After confirming their relationship last month on Instagram, it seems Selena’s head over heels for the producer, calling him “the best thing that ever happened” to her. But what about <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1681598>Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco’s friends’ response</a> to their relationship?</p><p>According to a source who recently spoke to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a>, it appears that Selena’s inner circle is all in for her happiness. “Everyone is so happy that she’s happy,” the source told the site. “Everyone was a fan of hers before <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1225150>Only Murders [in the Building]</a>, and now everyone is protective of her. With her cast and crew, the feeling is, ‘any boyfriend of Selena’s is a boyfriend of ours,'” the insider added.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/selena-gomez-love-on.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/timothee-kylie-selena-taylor.png><p>It’s a good thing that Sel’s crew is on board, because the Rare Beauty founder seems to be all in for this new romance. Replying to a fan’s comment on Instagram in December 2023, Selena gushed about the music producer, writing, “He is my absolute everything in my heart.” At the time, the couple had been together for around six months, according to Selena’s own comments.</p><p>Since then, the pair have been sharing sweet snaps on Instagram, and recently, they made their first public appearance at the Los Angeles Lakers game against the Miami Heat on January 3, 2023. Photos from the game show Selena cuddled up against Benny as they sat courtside, and admittedly, they looked pretty adorable together.</p><p>Following the game, a source spilled to People that Selena is “super happy and present” at this point of her life. “She seems to be really feeling herself at the moment,” the insider said. “Maybe that’s Benny, or maybe that’s just where she’s at personally and professionally.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/selena-gomez-benny-blanco.jpg><p>While most of her inner circle seems to be embracing her new beau, the jury’s still out on what Selena’s BFF Taylor Swift makes of her new relationship—but we may have gotten a clue thanks to Taylor’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce. It turns out that the NFL star has been keeping an eye on Selena’s love life. When GQ shared photos of Selena and Benny at the Lakers game on January 4, 2024, the Kansas City Chiefs player was quick to “like” the pictures, seemingly showing his support for the couple.</p><p>But, of course, there’s always a bit of drama. In October 2023, a source told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://pagesix.com/2023/10/30/entertainment/selena-gomez-concerned-taylor-swift-travis-kelce-moving-too-fast/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> that Selena was initially concerned about Taylor flaunting her new relationship with Travis. The insider claimed, “Selena thinks Taylor going to games and galavanting through New York immediately after just meeting Travis is something that is very unlike her.” The source added, “Historically, Taylor’s always been super private about everything, and now with this [relationship], she’s so open about it that it’s just very odd for Selena.”</p><p>However, by mid-November 2023, the tide seemed to turn. Another source told <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.etonline.com/selena-gomez-and-gigi-hadid-fully-support-taylor-swifts-relationship-with-travis-kelce-source-says rel=nofollow>Entertainment Tonight</a> that Selena now believes Taylor and Travis are “the real deal” and has become “a big supporter” of their relationship. It looks like Selena’s got her own love life on track while cheering on her friends’ romances from the sidelines, and even Travis Kelce is on board with the love fest!</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
