“We recognise that the world sees the Taiwan Strait as the next flashpoint [after Gaza and Ukraine], potentially leading to conflict. We do not wish for our children to shed blood for the Democratic Progressive Party,” Fu said, referring to Lai’s independence-leaning party.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>This Little Under $100 Croissant Bag Is Taking Over</h2><time>Mar 5, 2024</time>

Jamie Campbell Bower and his fiancee Bonnie Wright are officially over — and Bower, 23, may already be moving on.
“Bonnie and Jamie split a while ago,” an insider tells Us Weekly of the pair, who got engaged in April 2011. “It was amicable, but things had not been going right for some time. It’s sad.”
Prior to their engagement, Wright (known to Harry Potter fans for her portrayal of Ginny Weasley in the series) and Bower stayed relatively mum on their relationship; the pair first confirmed they were a couple at the BAFTAs in February 2010, though they had been dating since 2009.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/131/>← Prev Page</a>
