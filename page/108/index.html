With Halloween right around the corner, we're counting down the days by posting five fun or freaky facts about our favorite fright flicks.
Today's featured film is "The Exorcist."
1. The film is considered cursed. Ellen Burstyn injured her back while being thrown around the set. Actors Jack MacGowran and Vasiliki Maliaros both died before the movie was even released and a fire destroyed most of the set. A film-goer seeing the movie also broke his jaw after fainting.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Chinese biotech firm Clover signs deal to make millions of Covid-19 vaccines for Covax Facility</h2><time>Apr 14, 2024</time>

This is the very worst wickedness, that we refuse to acknowledge the passionate evil that is in us. This makes us secret and rotten.
D. H. Lawrence, the renowned English writer, once said, "This is the very worst wickedness, that we refuse to acknowledge the passionate evil that is in us. This makes us secret and rotten." This insightful quote powerfully highlights the significance of recognizing and confronting the darker aspects of our nature.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Gabrielle Epstein looks almost unrecognisable before surgery transformation</h2><time>Apr 14, 2024</time>

If you’re blogging like I’m doing here, it’s nice to be able to kick your posts out automatically to social networks (in addition to RSS). A reasonable list right now:
Mastodon Twitter (X) Facebook Threads LinkedIn Bluesky There are many more sites we’d consider social networks, but they aren’t as obviously a good fit for sharing blog posts. Instagram is a big social media player, but the best you can do for blog posts is publish a pull quote as an image or something and then do the “link in bio” to get someone to the post, and that’s too janky to be worth it to me.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>French Digital Influencer, Renan Pacheco Bio, Wiki, Relationship, Girlfriend, Campaign, and Net Wor</h2><time>Apr 13, 2024</time>
