But it's also because the industry is becoming more and more concerned about sustainability. While countless brands drop recycled and eco-conscious collections, experts are stressing that the most sustainable item is the one you already own. But if you still crave the dopamine hit that shopping brings, you could buy pre-loved pieces instead.</p><img alt="chanel bag street style" title="chanel bag street style" width=1024 height=631 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jill-asemota-wearing-chanel-black-and-white-bag-khaite-blue-news-photo-1682086784.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jeremy Moeller</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Watch how the iconic Chanel quilted handbag is made" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/38a08d0f-da9a-45ba-abf3-e6e680170452/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1617100613_88007.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So if you’ve been gearing up for a big purchase, like an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/g32573921/best-designer-handbags/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="investment handbag" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">investment handbag</a>, it might be worth considering a vintage option instead. There’s something nonchalant about a pre-loved bag, imbued with the patina of past owners’ stories, already slightly worn and softened with age.

Like the ever-appreciating Birkin, maintained value tends to be a signifier of timelessness – which makes it even more important to buy the right bag. Luckily the rise of ecommerce makes that a lot easier; because as romantic as sifting and thrifting at vintage stores and flea markets may seem, it's time consuming and doesn't come without risks.

You may know the 2.55 to be the most iconic of the house’s accessories, but did you know how many iterations it has?<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The original 2.55 debuted in – you guessed it – 1955. It was one of the first bags to come with a strap that enabled women to be hands-free rather than clutching the top handle of a framed bag or pouch. Frequently inspired by menswear, with a penchant for wearing it herself, Coco Chanel was already making waves with her practical approach to design. For the first time in history, women’s clothes had pockets, were made from comfortable fabrics like jersey, and forwent uncomfortable boning and petticoats. The 2.55 was both chic and liberating, so it comes as no surprise that it became an instant icon.</p><img alt="vintage chanel bag" title="vintage chanel bag" width=3550 height=3545 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vintagechanelbagbardotbridget-1660659397.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This diamond-quilted leather accessory had a chain strap (Chanel used to stitch chains to the hem of jackets and skirts to maintain the perfect drape) that floated within two rings, so it could go either over-the-shoulder or slip through to create a longer cross-body look. The burgundy interior had a handy divider, as well as a secret zipped compartment, and there was a slip pocket on the back for stowing cash or lipstick. Because of these details, some described the 2.55 as a 'rebellious' bag; who knew storage could be a signifier of the cosmopolitan, independent mid-century woman?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The lock is your best bet on determining when your 2.55 was made – it was one of the first things Karl Lagerfeld changed when he became creative director of the house in 1983. He switched the original 'Mademoiselle' oblong twist-lock to the double 'C' style we all know and love, succumbing to the logo-mania of the period (which, needless to say, proved successful). He also took on the leather-interwoven chain, sometimes used to bolster the original bags’ handles when supplies were running low, as a permanent feature. The quilted leather upper is often remembered in a diamond formation but matelassé and chevron styles soon followed, so it’s worth keeping an open mind when it comes to this detail. This re-issue is often referred to as the 11.12, or just the Chanel flap bag.</p><img alt="chanel flap bag" title="Chanel flap bag" width=4000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/16/24/1465993688-chanel-flap-bag.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">getty</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lagerfeld also introduced new iterations of this accessory during his stint at the French fashion house. His most famous designs are the Diana, created in 1989 for Diana, the Princess of Wales, and the Boy bag, named after Gabrielle Chanel's first lover, Arthur “Boy” Capel. Lagerfeld also changed the production methods of Chanel bags.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://go.linkby.com/POXWTNEA data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Lampoo class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Lampoo</a>’s head of brand valuation, Erika Vecchiatti, told us: "Before 2008 the flap bag's hardware was made from 24-karat gold, bearing a typical hallmark that showed the kind of metal." It is key details like this which make research imperative to investment buys.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Buying vintage Chanel bags:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It used to be just <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vestiairecollective.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vestiaire Collective" data-vars-ga-product-id=20e3fdb2-9536-4a8b-943a-600061344500 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-href=https://www.vestiairecollective.com/ data-product-url=https://www.vestiairecollective.com/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vestiairecollective.com%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$380.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=11c41c9d-ec82-4de9-b18a-833f856a3a51 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Vestiaire Collective</a> we would truly trust with such a big purchase as a Chanel bag.

While it might seem obvious, the counterfeits industry – which is incredibly lucrative – has been going strong for half a century now, so many suppliers have mastered the art of imitation.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Some signifiers are easy to spot, such as your matelassé and quilting stitches matching up at the seams – or the logo is a good indicator, says Vecchiatti. "It should be embossed directly onto the lining or an attached leather patch and say either 'Made in Italy' or 'Made in France'." It's always worth looking at the quality of the lining (there should be no bubbling) and the brand stamp inside the bag. "This should be the same colour as the bag’s hardware," she adds. "But on a real Chanel, metallic leafing may rub off, change colour or almost completely disappear, with strong signs of use."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are a few warning signs that may be less obvious. Tina Lipfriend, founder of rental site Bag Butler, shares her top tips here:<br></p><ul data-node-id=30 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>Use your common sense: if the item seems too affordable, it probably isn't genuine</li><li>Chanel quilting needs to be plump and full – it may still guide a positive authentication when deflated, but that doesn't mean it's still worth the price tag</li><li>A vintage piece needs to smell right – in other words, it should not smell new</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The team at Vestiaire Collective also warns of modifications or signs of wear and tear that can confuse authentication processes. "If you buy a secondhand Chanel bag, it could have been repaired or modified by its owner. Therefore, it’s essential to base your judgement mainly on the quality of the leather and lining, and on the weight of the hardware and straps."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Luckily, if you buy through the likes of Lampoo, Vestiaire Collective, Selfridges ReSell section, Farfetch or Cocoon, they have experts who will do this for you.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Are vintage Chanel bags more sustainable?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the simplest terms, buying secondhand is always more sustainable. Aside from shipping, you automatically bypass the carbon generated from production by buying something that already exists.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Chanel is a byword for luxury and, as such, is often imitated," says Lipfriend, Bag Butler's founder. She also points out the wider impact this has on the planet. "It is crucial to ensure that you are paying for the real thing, not only so that you aren’t duped, but to prevent more counterfeits circulating.

Anything 20 years old or more is officially classed as vintage, so bags made from 2000 onwards tend be tagged as pre-loved instead. Either is a more sustainable than buying new, as you're reducing your carbon footprint and extending a luxury item's lifespan.</p><h2 data-node-id=42 class="css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Where to rent a vintage Chanel handbag:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It can be wise to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/g30545044/best-fashion-rental-sites/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="rent your dream handbag" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">rent your dream handbag</a> first before investing – it allows you to see whether the design works for your lifestyle.

With the proper care, you can protect the value of your coveted purchase and preserve it as an heirloom for many years to come.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s worth understanding the fabrication of your chosen design as a first point of action. Leather is a skin and, as such, is prone to absorbing oils. To keep your lambskin or caviar leather handbag in optimal condition, wipe it down regularly with specialist care products.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jersey tweed Chanel bags, on the other hand, are susceptible to staining, which occurs when bacteria builds up in the fabric and causes darkening over time. Alongside at-home maintenance, it’s recommended to get a protective treatment for your handbag a few times a year, which is offered by professional restoration and repair services <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.handbagclinic.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Handbag Clinic" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Handbag Clinic</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theseam.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Seam" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Seam</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Charlotte Staerck, co-founder and CEO of The Handbag Clinic, advises getting a protective treatment every 2-3 months if you wear your handbag daily, and every 6-9 months if it’s more of a weekend bag or for special occasions. She also shares her top tips for ensuring the longevity of your Chanel bag:</p><ul data-node-id=52 class="css-yzf9pi emevuu60"><li>Minimise liquid staining by blotting the area with a clean, dry cloth to absorb as much of the liquid as possible. Follow by blotting with a damp cloth using warm water only. Start from the outside of the stain and working inwards to stop it from spreading. Remove excess liquid with a clean, dry cloth and leave to dry in a warm room. Once dried, hand it over to a professional if the stain remains.</li><li>Invest in a custom pillow to maintain the shape and structure of your Chanel handbag while not in use, and store in a high-quality dust bag to avoid dye transfer. When in use, don’t be tempted to overfill your handbag as excess friction can fade the metal work. If this occurs, simply freshen the appearance with metal polish.</li></ul><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmTEqa3TZquoZaearrN7wG1ncmhmbX9ye9Wipa2Zl5p6pLTAp5ylZZKWtHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jujutsu-kaisen-season-2-the-real-reason-why-mei-mei-is-hated-by-fans-explained-1249755.html><span>←</span><span>Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2: The REAL reason why Mei Mei is hated by fans EXPLAINED</span></a>
