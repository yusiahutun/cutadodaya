The new eight-episode series also follows the Minnesota Vikings'<strong>&nbsp;Kirk Cousins</strong> and the Atlanta Falcons' <strong>Marcus Mariota</strong> throughout the 2022 season.

We've certainly seen training camp. But we've never followed a quarterback throughout the entire season to see what he does Sunday night after a big win, after a brutal loss on a last-second field goal — what they do on Mondays and Tuesdays on their off days," Quarterback&nbsp;executive producer <strong>Peyton Manning&nbsp;</strong>told Netflix. "</p><p id=evOhj5qkGrl data-wc=44>Are they hanging out? Are they playing golf? Are they in the weight room and watching film and grinding for that next game?

It documents intimate moments with their families, friends, and trainers, following them from the field to their homes in a first-of-its-kind, in-depth look at the job.&nbsp;</p><p id=efV8bAZxyU data-wc=42>"It also reveals the many pressures involved: what it's like to receive an entire stadium's cheers or boos or be chased by a 300-pound defensive lineman and the reality of having to ask your loved ones to make sacrifices on your behalf."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm660tMiopWiblaGyo77IrbBmq6SuuaZ7k3Jubm5nZL62rdGtnKuakZi4brzAramim5tiuqK0zqacrGWnnrOmecGroK2skaPGbsPOsKpmrJmctbV50qKjr52iYrGzsdKsZKedpJu5qsSMqamepZmav6Z7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./olivia-attwood-admits-husband-bradley-dack-like-dog-bone-desperately-trying-rekindle-love-weighs-stormzy-maya-jamas-reunion-html.html><span>←</span><span>Olivia Attwood admits now-husband Bradley Dack was 'like a dog with a bone' while desperately trying</span></a>
