I met Omid when I first moved to Los Angeles from Brooklyn, NY and we clicked as friends and respective artists. Also, we kept running into one another at auditions so he was part of the “brown-actor” community as we would say jokingly.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The other soothing factor was his trust in Bryan Fuller, the show's executive producer.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I remember having a deep conversation with him about the nudity and telling him that I wanted to make sure we were not doing this to be shocking or gratuitous. And he truly walked me through his vision.
