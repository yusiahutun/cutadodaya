We know who should star... üòÖ."</p><p>The 500 Days of Summer actor also included a throwback of him standing next to the famed musician, and we have to admit, the resemblance is pretty striking. The post comes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>after Universal Pictures optioned the rights to Kiedis' autobiography Scar Tissue</strong></a>, which will be produced by Brian Grazer.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>In the caption, the actor and funny man made his case for starring in the film, along with a few Red Hot Chili Peppers puns and self-deprecating jokes.</p><p>"Someone please tag the Anthony Kiedis biopic's casting director. And yes, I realize I'll have to spend a lot of time in the gym. And take singing classes. And cool classes. And not wear glasses. And I realize it's going to be a long casting process‚Ä¶," Long wrote, acknowledging the tall task at hand. "It's an important role so they're not just gonna give it away, give it away, give it away now. And I obviously won't be making lame jokes like that while I'm in character as Anthony ü§ìüå∂Ô∏è#RedHotChiliAuditioner."</p><p>The 45-year-old actor was met with lots of support from fans and celebs alike, with New Girl's Lamorne Morris writing, "I believe in this," and Joel McHale calling Long's resemblance to Kiedis "remarkable."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:31af79a3-1457-4112-bf23-621b9deeffe6 data-container-ref=toofab:article:7dbdbb97-8402-4e83-aa4f-29acca2d958d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f8/5by4/2023/05/19/f81da29d26684bf696636323d3fb86cc_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Gety/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kate Bosworth Holds Hands With Husband Justin Long BTS of 'Blue Crush' Roxy Bikini Shoot</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Long's wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title=https://toofab.com/tags/katebosworth/><strong>Kate Bosworth</strong></a>, even weighed in, voicing her vote for her husband's campaign while poking a little fun at her better half at the same time.</p><p>"I also personally know how committed you are to singing his songs EVERY SINGLE NIGHT, playing air guitar in the kitchen in your underwear," Bosworth wrote. "It's a no brainer."</p><p>Long responded to Bosworth's slightly embarrassing comment, with of course, another pun referencing the rock band, writing, "@katebosworth üé∂'sometimes I feel like I don‚Äôt have a partner‚Ä¶ who keeps my daily Red Hot Chili Training private' ü§êü§î."</p><p>While Bosworth was quick to tease Long, their playful banter is all part of what makes their relationship flow, with the Blue Crush alum telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Entertainment Tonight</strong></a> Monday that pair work "really well together."</p><p>"I always say like, he is the flow and I am the structure and those things work really well together," Bosworth told the outlet of her relationship with her husband. "If you were working with him, he'd be like, 'Yeah, whatever, go for it.' He's the complete opposite. So we're a good balance that way for sure."</p><a id=gallery-link-f19777b9-441d-4d39-96d6-e74aede4d0e0 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:f19777b9-441d-4d39-96d6-e74aede4d0e0 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:7dbdbb97-8402-4e83-aa4f-29acca2d958d data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1c/4by3/2024/01/22/1c907d5fdf694566a474bd36ce7ceb6c_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pma2pfn8K0wMinZKWnnpx6pK3MqZiin56oeqe70WaYp6yYpLu6ecqinJ2ho2KvqrvPoppmo5Gpsm6uzqyuqKqknXq4scign6xlmaN8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-human-skeleton-it-is-our-reserve-but-it-does-not-blush.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>A skeleton: its a good thing bones dont blush | Helen Sullivan</span></a>
