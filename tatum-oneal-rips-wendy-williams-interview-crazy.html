"She was like 'you were molested!'...'your dad gave you cocaine to lose weight right?'"</p><p>"It was like non-sequitur after non-sequitur," O'Neal added. "She was like looking through me."</p><p>"I think that's she's even a little bit more non-sequitur since she dropped, since she <strong><a href=#>had the fainting thing</a></strong>," O'Neal continued.

O'Neal appeared on Williams' morning talk show to promote her new film, "God's Not Dead: A Light In Darkness," or at least, that was the intent.</p><p>Although her interview might have been crazy, O'Neal did still express her concern for Williams.
