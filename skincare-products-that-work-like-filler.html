There are, however, plenty of <a href=# rel=noopener>skincare products that work&nbsp;like&nbsp;filler</a> to defy gravity and restore volume when you’re feeling a bit, well, sunken.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Dermal fillers and injectables</a> are obviously the only sure-fire, in-office treatments that yield instant results, but these alternative skincare treatments and beauty tools will give you a similar effect with continuous use (consistency is key). For me, skincare is self-care and frankly, an act of self-love, so why not take to at-home treatments to keep your skin looking bouncy and supple and your confidence at its peak?</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anua-heartleaf-toner-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/olivercabellsneakersale.png><p>To get the low down on the best OTC skincare products for plump and supple skin, we went straight to the experts to get their suggestions. After all, as someone who performs dermal <a href=# id=auto-tag_fillers data-tag=fillers>fillers</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Botox and lip injections</a> on the daily, who better to ask for the next best thing to going under the needle? “I swear by consistent microcurrent treatments. This is going to retrain your facial muscles to go back to where they once were when you were younger. For example, brows will be lifted, cheeks will regain shape and life, and frown lines will be lessened. It’s truly the best alternative to fillers! Nuface has a great at-home option you can use in between treatments,” advises <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Rachel Liverman, CEO and Co-Founder of Glowbar</a>.</p><p>Generally speaking, these plumping skincare products work by causing the skin to temporarily swell up, and therefore fill in lines and texture. It’s kind of the similar effect you experience when you apply a plumping lip gloss—but without the tingle. Aside from beauty tools and facial massagers, <a href=# rel=noopener>moisture-retaining hyaluronic acid</a> and elastin-boosting collagen are your next best bets.</p><p>“As we age, we lose our hyaluronic acid and collagen that keep our skin looking youthful,” says <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Nurse Nancy Pellegrino, (aka Nurse Nancy)</a>, RN, MN, NP, owner and operator of NP Aesthetics Inc, and co-founder of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">THE ROUTE Beauty</a>.</p><p>Hyaluronic acid is able to hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water, which allows the humectant to restore moisture levels in even the most parched skin, as well as promote firmness and soften the look of fine lines over time. While topical collagen can be controversial when it comes to its effectiveness, reaching for a product that contains both the naturally-occurring protein, as well as other <a href=# rel=noopener>anti-aging actives</a>, will help give “fill in” fine lines and restore fullness. Below, find our favorite skin-plumping products for a juicy, glowing complexion <a href=# rel=noopener>minus the needles</a>.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
