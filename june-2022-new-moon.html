As a cardinal sign, Cancers are visionaries, driven to set ambitious goals and initiate big picture projects. And that's just one reason that June's new moon in the sign of the Crab is one you'll want to take advantage of.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Falling on Tuesday, June 28 at 10:52 p.m. ET/7:52 p.m. PT, this emotionally-charged astrological event could be one of those new moons that actually feels more like a full moon. But instead of being a gasp-worthy, drama-packed culmination point, it'll serve as a launch pad for getting after a dream that's connected to your sense of security and inner bliss.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-new-moon-in-cancer-is-a-time-to-tend-to-your-nest></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The new moon in Cancer is a time to tend to your nest.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">New moons — which happen when the confident sun pairs up with the intuitive moon — always present a monthly opportunity to get clear on which new chapter you want to write over the course of the next two weeks (up until the next full moon) and next six months (when the corresponding full moon occurs). Most new moons are considered opportune times to check ourselves and consider how we've been faring in a particular area of life, and this particular one, falling in Cancer, which is ruled by the moon itself, is a chance to touch base with your heart, spirit, and inner world.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In general, Cancer new moons set the stage for self-reflective practices like meditation, journaling, doing a ritual with your tarot cards or crystals, or even just carving out dedicated time to connect with the people who know you best. Any kind of domestic routine that brings you a sense of comfort and security (like cooking a favorite recipe, tending to your plant babies, or zhushing your wall art) can also be a fantastic way to get grounded and figure out what direction you'll do best to move in now.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-moons-square-to-jupiter-will-crank-up-the-intensity-of-whatever-it-is-youre-feeling-now></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The moon's square to Jupiter will crank up the intensity of whatever it is you're feeling now.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not only is this new moon ruled by la luna herself, but it'll form a tight square — the most tense but also activating angle between two planets or points — to Jupiter, the planet of expansion and abundance, in fiery, impulsive <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Aries</a>. Because it's one of the benefic (aka helpful, positive) planets in astrology, a square to Jupiter is rarely as daunting as to, say, aggressive Mars or power-hungry Pluto. But it will amplify and magnify whatever emotions are coming up for you around this transit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jupiter also tends to nudge us to hit the gas, even when we're not quite ready or bite off more than we can chew. So being that assertive, go-getter cardinal energy sets the tone of this new moon, you could be tempted to take action sooner versus later or by committing to more than you can realistically handle. It's a case for doing your best to go slow and be mindful of how you want to proceed.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-neptunes-retrograde-serves-up-reality-checks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Neptune's retrograde serves up reality checks.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's been tough to decipher fact from fiction with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mercury retrograde</a> from May 10 to June 3 and then moving through the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>retroshade period</a> up until June 18. Thankfully, the planet of communication is now plowing full steam ahead, making it easier to nail down the correct info you need to move the ball forward. On the same day as the new moon, another eye-opening transit will make it easier to think logically: Neptune will go retrograde until December 3. While the planet of dreams and spirituality moves forward, it tends to cloud rational thought, but when its retrograde, it can be easier to take off those rose-colored glasses and see the truth of any given matter — for better or worse.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Neptune retrogrades are slow-moving events that certainly won't clobber you over the head like a faster-paced Mercury backspin, this year's could make it easier to understand what's really going in a relationship, at your job, or with your health, so that you can set an even more precise and powerful new moon intention.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fiery-mars-will-be-moving-toward-a-square-with-shadowy-pluto></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Fiery Mars will be moving toward a square with shadowy Pluto.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Remember how Jupiter's considered a benefic in astrology? Well, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mars — the planet of aggression, anger, and energy</a> — is one of the malefics, often presenting us with challenges we need to overcome. While not traditionally considered a malefic, Pluto — the planet of control issues, power, death, and rebirth — usually pushes us to face some of our darkest shadows, which can no doubt be overwhelming and even disturbing. And on the day of the new moon, Mars will be approaching a square to Pluto, laying the groundwork for potentially explosive power struggles. It's just one of the reasons that this lunar event might be a bit more volatile than the average Cancer new moon. But it's also an opportunity to pick your battles — then go all in on whatever it is you've decided is worth your time, energy, and passion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here, how this Cancer new moon will affect you, based on your sign. (Pro-tip: Be sure to read both your sun and your rising sign, if you know it. If you don't, you can find it on your natal chart or via this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>CafeAstrology calculator</a>.)</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Aries (March 21-April 19)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This new moon falls in your fourth house of home life, squaring off against Jupiter in your sign and first house of self, so you may find yourself butting heads with loved ones because you're feeling out how you want to stand in your sense of self. However, moving through this challenge could strengthen your security and sense of calm.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Taurus (April 20-May 20)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With the new moon in your third house of communication squaring Jupiter in your twelfth house of spirituality, you'll be especially in touch with your intuition — and sense of curiosity — now.
