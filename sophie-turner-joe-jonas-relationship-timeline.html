Soon, they married and welcomed two children. Throughout their relationship, they’ve supported each other on red carpets and shared glimpses of their love story on social media and on interviews—which is why fans were surprised when news broke that the stars’ union had reached its end.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ahead, see everything we know about Turner and Jonas’s yearslong relationship and recent split.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">September 21, 2023: Sophie files a lawsuit against Joe over the “wrongful retention” of her kids.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Turner <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a45245723/sophie-turner-sues-joe-jonas-children-wrongfully-retained/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="files a lawsuit" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">files a lawsuit</a> against Jonas over the “wrongful retention” of their two kids, three-year-old Willa and a one-year-old daughter referred to as D. in documents.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The suit, which was obtained by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/sophie-turner-sues-joe-jonas-demands-kids-be-returned-to-england-amid-split-7972708 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a>, demands “the immediate return of children wrongfully removed or wrongfully retained.” Turner’s legal team alleges the children’s “wrongful retention” began on September 20.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The court documents claim: “The Father has possession of the children’s passports. He refuses to return the passports to the Mother and refuses to send the children home to England with the Mother.” Jonas’s attorney reportedly confirmed to Turner’s team on September 19 that, not only would he not hand over the passports, he is also withholding consent for his daughters to move to England.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the suit, Turner alleges that she and Jonas had decided to make England their “forever home” during conversations that occurred in December 2022. Thereafter, they sold their mansion in Miami and began to look for residences in the English countryside in April. Around this time, the Game of Thrones alum also began filming a new drama series, Joan.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Jonas began his world tour with the Jonas Brothers last month, the couple decided Willa and D. would stay with him, since he “had more daytime hours to be available to them than Turner did amid filming,” People says—noting that the lawsuit says Turner had “hesitation” over the “temporary arrangement.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On August 15, the end to the couple’s four-year marriage occurred “very suddenly,” Turner says in the suit.

I just wanna say, look, if you don’t hear it from these lips, don’t believe it. Okay?” he said during an interlude. “Thank you everyone for your love and support. Me and my family love you guys.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During the show, Jonas is also <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tiktok.com/@aliciamelville/video/7277085730642332970 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="seen getting emotional" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">seen getting emotional</a> and wiping tears from his eyes while singing “Hesitate,” which he wrote about Turner.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">September 6, 2023: Joe and Sophie confirm their split.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a heartbreaking statement shared on Instagram, the former couple confirm they are divorcing. “After four wonderful years of marriage we have mutually decided to amicably end our marriage,” the message reads. “There are many speculative narratives as to why but, truly this is a united decision and we sincerely hope that everyone can respect our wishes for privacy for us and our children.”</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">September 6, 2023: A source share details on the stars' split.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jonas tried to “salvage” his marriage to Turner before filing for divorce Tuesday, a source close to the family tells <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://pagesix.com/2023/09/05/unhappy-joe-jonas-tried-to-salvage-sophie-turner-marriage-filed-for-divorce-as-last-resort/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Page Six" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Page Six</a>. “Divorce was a last resort for Joe.

There’s a lot of noise out there, but it wasn’t a straw-that-broke-the-camel’s-back situation like it’s being reported.”</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">September 5, 2023: Joe files for divorce.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s official.
