Rob Lowe & Sheryl Berkoff - 29 Years</strong></p><p>Rob Lowe and his makeup artist wife Sheryl Berkoff first met in the '80s through a mutual friend. They reconnected on the set of “Bad Influence” and began dating, tying the knot in July of 1991. The couple shared children Edward and John.</p><p>"I really attribute it to that we picked the right partners. She picked the right partner for her. I picked the right partner for me, and at the end of it, we're best friends. We don't try to change each other. We're very forgiving of each other's faults but the other thing is, each of us are really willing to work on our relationship when we need it and, listen, over 30 years there are times when we need it," Rob said on his Literally! With Rob Lowe podcast.</p><p><strong>2. Tom Hanks & Rita Wilson - 32 Years</strong></p><p>Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson originally met on the set of "Bosom Buddies" and later reconnected while filming "Volunteers." The duo got married in April of 1988 and now have 2 children -- Chet and Truman.</p><p>"When we first looked at each other there was definitely a kind of, 'Hey, this is the place!'—I felt that anyway. I think the end result is that we got married for all the right reasons," Tom told <a href=#>ET</a>.</p><p><strong>3. Meryl Streep & Don Gummer - 42 Years</strong></p><p>Meryl Streep met husband Don Gummer less than a year after her boyfriend &nbsp;John Cazale passed away from cancer. The duo were introduced by Meryl’s brother in 1978 and tied the knot later that year. They went on to welcome children Louisa, Grace, Mamie and Henry.</p><p>"First, I'm going to thank Don because when you thank your husband at the end of the speech they play him out with the music, and I want him to know that everything I value most in our lives, you've given me," Meryl said in her Academy Awards acceptance speech in 2012.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ac72c281-e431-56b0-84ee-d620e879c434 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d3a8a440-ca6c-4343-bc98-d9eac0e00423 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/49/5by4/2019/09/30/498ee10f699858a787864a275f1e82b7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC/Everett Collection</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Rob Lowe Reacts to Demi Moore's Memoir, Calls Her Sobriety a 'Huge Inspiration' for Him</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>4. Billy & Janice Crystal - 50 Years</strong></p><p>Billy Crystal and his wife Janice have been together since their teen years. The couple said "I do" during a ceremony in 1970, which means the couple have been married for five decades! The duo share two children - Jennifer and Lindsay.</p><p>"We laugh a lot. We've grown together, we’ve parented together, we've grandparented together. I'm lucky that I found the person when I was 18," Billy told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>.</p><p><strong>5. Lisa Kudrow & Michel Stern - 25 Years</strong></p><p>Lisa Kudrow met her ad executive husband Michel Stern through a friend in 1987 but didn't start dating for several years. Then in 1995, the very private couple officially tied the knot and welcomed their son Julian three years later.</p><p>"[Michel and I] respect each other's independence, and I don't mean that as a euphemism. I don't mean relationship-wise outside the marriage. Clear? But I don't like to travel. So if he wants to go on a golf trip, he goes. I think people get in trouble [when they assume they're] supposed to be one unit, in sync about everything. [Marriage] is like being on a team. Each teammate is different, but you have the same goal," Lisa told <a href=#>Glamour</a> Magazine.</p><p><strong>6. Bryan Cranston & Robin Dearden - 31 Years</strong></p><p>Bryan Cranston and his wife Robin Dearden met on the set of "Airwolf" in 1986, but were both in other relationships at the time. They ran into each other again a few years later and got married in 1989.</p><p>"I think it was serendipitous, because, as Robin says, if we had been unencumbered at the time and started dating, she doesn’t think that we would have stayed together. But because she had a boyfriend and I had a girlfriend, we were able to flirt without the heavy sexual tension, but there was sexual tension, let me tell you," Bryan told <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p>The couple have one daughter named Taylor.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:dbc3899d-4d5a-457d-a96c-389418baf723 data-container-ref=toofab:article:d3a8a440-ca6c-4343-bc98-d9eac0e00423 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/66/5by4/2020/08/13/66c44fc3ae814e8caf62f157e5e266f7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">10 Celebrity Couples Who Had to Postpone Their 2020 Weddings</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>7.

I think respect in general and love are two things that we could use a lot more of," Harry told <a href=#>Fox News</a>.</p><p><strong>8. Steve Carell & Nancy Walls - 25 Years</strong></p><p>Steve Carell and his wife Nancy Walls met in 1995 when he was teaching an improv class at Second City in Chicago and got married the same year. Throughout the years, the duo have worked together often, including Nancy’s guest appearance on “The Office.”</p><p>"I knew early on that she was the right one. I'll never forget standing at the altar and I saw her coming down the aisle—immediately a sense of calm came over me. There was an ethereal sense of how right it all was and more than anything it was very empowering knowing that person was going to be my partner and have my back. It just made me feel strong, and I'll never forget it," Steve told <a href=#>The Guardian</a>.</p><p>Steve and Nancy have two children - Elisabeth and John.</p><p><strong>9. Michael J. Fox & Tracy Pollan - 32 Years</strong></p><p>Michael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan met when they were cast as love interests on "Family Ties" in the 1980s.

Eventually, the duo found their way to each other and made things official in 1988. Michael and Tracy have stuck together in the good times and bad, like when Michael was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>"Through it all we've loved each other," Michael told <a href=#>O Magazine</a>, with Tracy adding, "And that love never died. We had a solid foundation to begin with."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:38f0268b-cb7f-43e3-a761-d8842cb1a26f data-container-ref=toofab:article:d3a8a440-ca6c-4343-bc98-d9eac0e00423 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b8/5by4/2020/08/31/b86faac64f5047d49fb99b14e65963d1_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Katy Perry Opens Up About Short-Lived Marriage to Russell Brand</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>10.

But my marriage and my family have been a priority. That may sound stupid. Many people would say exactly that. But I worked very, very hard to keep us intact. And it's been my pleasure, because it's the only way I could have survived in this business — with my family unit in place," Julia told the <a href=#>New York Times</a>.</p><p><strong>11.

If you’re lucky enough to find your soulmate, you have to keep your fingers crossed. A really short manual would read ‘Don’t cheat,’ because that seems to be where people break up. When you go through tricky periods you have to work on it and having children helps because you know you’re trying to find a way to make everyone happy."</p><p><strong>12.

They were married that same year.</p><p>"Chris and I have a wonderful, complicated, imperfect life. And a very real marriage. I'll never know why I thought we'd understand each other when I saw his photograph. Hidden in that smirk, I think, was a little secret that only I knew," Jamie wrote on <a href=#>Oprah.com</a>.</p><p>Jamie and Christoper share children Annie and Thomas.</p><p><strong>13. Ringo Starr & Barbara Bach - 39 Years</strong></p><p>Ringo Starr and Barbara Bach met in 1980 on the set of "Caveman" where Ringo immediately fell in love with her.

I just think that you have to work at it. Not give up on each other. It's a commitment. It's not all the honeymoon, it doesn't last forever, so you work at it.
