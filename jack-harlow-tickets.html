I’m not trying to manifest it either. But I’m just saying inevitably that’s what happens. I see sparks of it just like any big artist sees. But all the people that are championing me are going to turn on me. And now I have a good feeling that they’re going to turn back around. I’m starting to realize that humility is just more important than ever right now. Just keeping a hold of that because it’s a long way down if you get with the hype.”</p><p>So…where can fans buy Jack Harlow tickets?

Harlow’s Come Home the Kids Miss You Tour set list won’t be known until his first concert at the <span class=s1>Nashville Municipal Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, on September, 6, 2022. However, it’s expected that most of the set list will include songs from Harlow’s second studio album, Come Home the Kids Miss You, which was released in May 2022 and received positive reviews from publications like Variety, Clash and Rolling Stone. The album also features collaborations with artists like Pharrell Williams, Drake, Justin Timberlake and Lil Wayne.&nbsp;</span></p><p>In an interview with Apple Music One’s Zane Lowe in May 2022, Harlow revealed that Drake, Jay-Z and Kanye West are his musical inspirations. “We’ve had our talks. But more than anything, I just take notes from him [Drake] on his actions. He’s leaving a blueprint behind, you know what I’m saying?” he said. “The same way Jay left a blueprint. Same way Ye left a blueprint. He’s creating a blueprint that you don’t have to… It’s not rocket science to follow. You can just see, okay, these are some great decisions. You just see it.”</p><p>He continued, “And so I just pull from the playbook of all the legends where it resonates with me. Ye is a huge one for me, just resonates with me massively. I see what he did. But I think it all just comes from just being the route of just not being a street artist. Because it’s just something so traditionally street about this genre. And if you’re not street… I’m not the first artist to come through that isn’t that. And so inevitably I’m going to take notes. Any comparisons I see, it’s inevitable where there’s a cloth, you know what I’m saying? This is just what comes with it.”</p><p>Harlow responded to claims he’s an “industry plant” who didn’t work for his success. “My career had very humble beginnings, that’s why anytime I see my name associated with anything like ‘industry plant,’ it makes me so proud to really be able to say that I’m like, out of everyone in the game right now, one of the furthest from it,” he said. “I didn’t skip any steps, bro, like I did steps none of these kids did.”&nbsp; He continued, “I talk about it on records, but I did open mics, I did South by Southwest, I did A3C, I did showcases with no one there. My first tour, I went to Madison, Wisconsin, did a bar with eight people in it, like I felt those feelings of not being the guy at all.Yeah, bravado on record, but then I’m going around and finding out I’m not the guy. I felt all, I did this, but it’s like you said, once you’re there in this bubble, and if people didn’t see any of that, they’re like, ‘Where’d he come from? Wow, he just got it dropped in his lap.'”</p><p><span class=s1>See the full track list for Come Home the Kids Miss You below.</span></p><li><span class=s1>“Talk of the Town”</span></li><li><span class=s1>Young Harleezy”</span></li><li><span class=s1>“I’d Do Anything to Make You Smile”</span></li><li><span class=s1>“First Class”</span></li><li><span class=s1>“Dua Lipa”</span></li><li><span class=s1>“Side Piece”</span></li><li>“Movie Star” (featuring Pharrell Williams)</li><li>“Lil Secret”</li><li>“I Got a Shot”</li><li>“Churchill Downs” (featuring Drake)</li><li>“Like a Blade of Grass”</li><li>“Parent Trap” (featuring Justin Timberlake)</li><li>“Poison” (featuring Lil Wayne)</li><li>“Nail Tech”</li><li>“State Fair”</li><h2>Who are Jack Harlow’s Come Home the Kids Miss You Tour opening acts?</h2><p>Who are Jack Harlow’s Come Home the Kids Miss You Tour opening acts?
