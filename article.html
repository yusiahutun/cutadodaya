They might not all wear Dior or Gaultier, but they're well co-ordinated and thoughtful in their attire. Dirty sneakers are scarce (usually on tourists) and hair is often meticulously styled.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the very first things I noticed about French men is how well they know their denim. Their jeans are well fitted and they match them with a jacket or pullover. Mind you, the weather in Paris is not as hot and humid as Hong Kong, so being able to layer helps one to style. But even when they wear just a V-neck T-shirt, they finish off the look with a light cotton style that adds a nice touch.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Take reference from Zadig and Voltaire, which matches cotton trousers with a cotton tunic with a mandarin collar, and a bicolore scarf (right). These scarves are easy to carry around, as they are naturally wrinkly and come in handy when you brave the indoor winter Hong Kong is known for. Or go to Givenchy, where a scarf with eyelets is matched with a Latino-fit long-sleeved voile shirt over a white and black print jersey T-shirt, flat-fronted trousers and two-buckle derbies in black leather (bottom right).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Looking French doesn't necessarily mean wearing French brands -- it's about experimentation and self-expression. You see variety in the way Frenchmen dress and they don't just follow a look from the catalogue.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the Season Lounge Spirit party, a weekly drinks gathering for the Parisian style set, I saw men immaculately decked out in suits. But there was also a man in a biker jacket with a red shirt and a red striped tie, another in a yellow tee with a lavender scarf and another in a brown scarf with a red polka-dot shirt. Even though the combinations aren't what I expected, everything worked perfectly and there's no reason why Asian men can't follow their lead.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other than beautiful people to look at, it's also not hard to find beautiful things to buy in Paris. After visiting an exhibition at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, I went to the museum's boutique. It's one of those places that makes you want to buy up the whole shop.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There, a pair of red moccasins presented themselves. Designed by Spanish artist Jaime Hayon for Camper as part of the Camper Together line and inspired by dance shoes, they were made from monotone leather with a rubber sole of the same colour (above right). They were eccentric yet versatile, simple in design but thought-provoking. Putting them on, I felt like a million dollars ... Well, about Euro300 (HK$3,225).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unfortunately, they didn't have my size, so to ease my sense of loss I turned to shirts. Great shirt shops are absolutely everywhere in Paris, and they aren't expensive. There is always the shopping mecca of Galeries Lafayette, but the best finds on my trip were from independent boutiques. During a leisurely stroll on rue La Fayette, I found Chiarelli, a hole in the wall that sells fantastic Italian shirts with handsomely decorated collars (top). I bought one with a red floral pattern and another in blue with white polka dots. They've become perfect partners for my D&G grey pinstripe suit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Also worth visiting is Bruce Field, which specialises in shirts. I scored a parma violet one with black buttons and black details on the collar and cuffs that's classic yet edgy (bottom left).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the Marais, I couldn't walk more than 20 steps without stopping. There were lots of great shops, including another shirt specialist, Coton Doux, and high-end funky boutique L'Eclaireur, featuring well-known names such as Dior, Comme des Garcons and Dries Van Noten, as well as a lineup of experimental brands. Being able to shop happily at street level was also a joy to someone from mall city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ever since I came back I have been lamenting why Hong Kong men can't be more like their Parisian counterparts. I've been going to Sevva - the closest equivalent to the party I can think of. But even on the best day the punters still look like a crowd of off-work bankers. Perhaps it's unfair to compare. Paris is Paris, after all.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Shopping list:</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">107Rivoli, Rue de Rivoli 107, Paris, tel: 33 1 42 60 64 94</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bruce Field, brucefield.com</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chiarelli, Rue La Fayette 91, Paris, tel: 33 1 48 74 74 05</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Coton Doux, cotondoux.com</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Givenchy, Ocean Centre, Harbour City, TST, tel: 2735 2361</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">L'Eclaireur, Rue Mahler 12, Paris, leclaireur.com</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zadig and Voltaire, Pacific Place, Admiralty, tel: 2918 9522</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdmbYJyhY9opJ6soqQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breaking-pollstar-to-move-to-los-angeles.html><span>←</span><span>Pollstar To Move To Los Angeles</span></a>
