The couple first met at a local bar while they were both students at Georgia Southern University. They dated on and off throughout college before going their separate ways after Luke graduated.&nbsp;</p><p id=efQ1jTwZ2o data-wc=57>They reunited after five years apart and have been together ever since. Luke and Caroline share five children, sons Thomas, 15, and Tatum, 12. They also adopted their nephew, Til, and two nieces, Jordan and Kris following the tragic death of Luke's sister Kelly in 2007, and Kelly's husband Ben 'Lee' Cheshire, who passed away in 2017.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1a595b8c293a-luke-bryan-children.jpg><p id=eVfpgziyRX data-wc=53>Caroline once opened up about welcoming Til, Jordan, and Kris into their family home during an interview with <a class=hm-link href=#>Good Morning America'</a>s <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Robin Roberts.</a> She explained: <strong>"You know, it was never something that he and I had to sit down and talk about. 'Should we take this on?' We just did that."</strong>&nbsp;</p><p id=eopkI_1ZZuT data-wc=44>Luke's sister passed away unexpectedly in May 2007, and tragically her husband Lee died seven years later from a heart attack aged just 46. In September 2021, Luke was brimming with pride and emotion as he walked Jordan down the aisle at her wedding.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eac1b2dddb3f-luke-bryan-wife-kids.jpg><p id=eNyJggl93R data-wc=62>Shortly after the special day, Luke told ABC News: "To get to walk Jordan down the aisle was the coolest, literally one of the most emotional things I've ever done." The star revealed how they made sure to celebrate both Kelly and Lee's memories at Jordan's wedding, including adding their wedding bands to Jordan's bouquet and leaving two empty chairs for them.&nbsp;</p><p id=eDFXaQwd-H1 data-wc=37>"It was just a beautiful ceremony, a beautiful time," he said after the ceremony.

Luke confided that he has had "so many tragedies in life… Maybe Chris and Kelly and Lee have moved some puzzle pieces around to make my life so fortunate. When I say my prayers at night, I have to say, 'Thank y'all for looking after us down here.'"</p><p id=euCJlz0r-dG_ data-wc=9><strong>See more photos of Luke and his family below.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3da12a005bcc-luke-bryan-sons.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b24220c142ab-luke-bryan-wife.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/39d6a3ce746d-caroline-bryan-son.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/357193bbe4e8-luke-bryan-caroline-boyer.jpg><p id=eTfoth738r data-wc=6>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
