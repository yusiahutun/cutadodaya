But if you love the look of a little added glow, you won’t regret investing in a bottle of the stuff. Not quite a self-tanner (although there are plenty of tinted options!), and not quite highlighter, these nourishing, glistening little numbers will turn lackluster-looking skin into a dewy dream. Though many options come in lightweight oil form, they also exist in powders, lotions and sticks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Yet, if body shimmers trigger nightmares of greasy formulas packed with so much chunky glitter you could barely get it out of the bottle, we hear you, and we were non-believers at first too. However, we found that today's body shimmers, thankfully, are wildly different. These silky, lightweight formulas boast skin softening ingredients to provide supple hydration, and are packed with delicate light reflecting particles that deliver radiance by the bucketload.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Quite simply, our faves feel and look fabulously luminous on skin. Not to mention, they dry down quickly to avoid transfer, never leave a sticky finish, and unfailingly deliver a warm glow that we sport all year round.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-nuxe-huile-prodigieuse-or-multi-purpose-shimmering-dry-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nuxe Shimmering Dry Oil Huile Prodigieuse</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Nuxe Huile 'Prodigieuse Or' Multi Usage Dry Oil Golden Shimmer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZFmXWtUuXT1RT5OdrOZL3nc-HKo=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Nuxe-Huile-Prodigieuse-Or-Multi-Usage-Dry-Oil-Golden-Shimmer-787f1c7b791d4b46816066f3df510452.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s no coincidence that all the beauty lovers of the world flock towards French beauty products — those iconic Gallic labels really know what they’re doing. “This French brand is one of my must-have purchases when visiting French pharmacies,” says Rachel Lee Lozina, a New York state-licensed esthetician and owner at Blue Water Spa. (But don’t worry: You can also score a bottle of this precious oil at Amazon or on the brand’s own site.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lozina is a huge fan of this dry oil’s scent, which combines orange blossom, magnolia and vanilla for a sweet and floral blend. It's definitely on the strong side, but if fresh, flirty aromas are your thing, you'll adore it. "It also has tsubaki oil, argan oil and macadamia, and is enriched with mineral-origin golden pearly particles for a dewy glow without a dewy feel — and it can be used on body, face and hair,” says Lorinza. “And, because this is a dry oil, it doesn’t leave a film on the skin.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Joy Adenuga, an award-winning celebrity makeup artist, also notes that this beaming oil dries really quickly, so you won't have to wait very long to get dressed (or sit on your couch) after applying. “The dry body oil provides a radiant finish, giving your skin a touch of ethereal glow,”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Tsubaki oil, argan oil, macadamia oil, borage oil, camellia oil, hazelnut oil, sweet almond oil | <strong>Scent</strong>: Vanilla with a hint of citrus |<strong> Size: </strong>100 ml</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-colourpop-sol-shimmering-dry-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ColourPop Sol Shimmering Dry Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ColourPop Sol Shimmering Dry Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gPHytfCXQ4qbdND6KsQg7kwDe60=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ColourPop-Sol-Shimmering-Dry-Oil-c3afb5870f7b414aad30b6e5698cb700.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>ColourPop</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Body shimmer makes a fabulous addition to your body care collection, but the hefty price tags can be quite a turnoff. That’s why we’re super impressed with ColourPop’s featherlight body oil, which actually gives their more luxurious counterparts a real run for their money.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Available in a range of nine stunning shades from soft champagne gold to pearlescent silver to richly vibrant gold-bronze (the brand is called ColourPop, after all), these lightweight oils compliment all skin tones and satisfy every shimmer aesthetic. Being a dry oil — which is any oil that sinks into skin without leaving a wash of oily residue in its wake — the formula disappears into skin quickly to help minimize any sparkle rubbing off skin and onto clothes. (To further protect your wardrobe, the brand recommends applying and blending the oil with a brush instead of your hands.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Formula-wise, it features a nourishing blend of plant- and fruit-based oils, including coconut, argan, and the fatty acid-rich hero, marula, which work together to soften skin without leaving behind a greasy, sticky feel. Bonus: The aroma from the coconut oil makes for a deliciously tropical scent that just screams “summer vacation.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to the shimmer, you can expect a heavy dose it, and unlike other options, these particles are multidimensional , this dry oil gives skin a sparkly high shine look. While it doesn't veer into full-blown glitter territory, it's not subtle either, so if it's glam you're going for, this will do the trick. Plus, the formula has a lot of feel-good qualities too: It's vegan, cruelty-free, and you can send the bottle back to the brand to recycle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Coconut oil, argan oil, marula oil | <strong>Scent</strong>: Fruity with coconut |<strong> Size: </strong>3 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-costa-brazil-sol-sunlight-body-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Costa Brazil Sol Sunlight Body Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Costa Brazil Sol Sunlight Body Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/f6ecnZmod_Cjjg_3gxtwVGxNwmM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Costa-Brazil-Sol-Sunlight-Body-Oil-6583fa845f414bc4a2b46b0e8d0e0fe8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We don't take our splurge products lightly, and the decadent, shimmery oil from this buzzy brand not only looks straight out of a five-star spa, but it feels like it too. For an impossibly sophisticated, grown-up take on a traditional body shimmer, look no further. This super-luxe body oil is lush, yet lightweight, and sinks into skin easily and quickly, while the almost silly amount of nutrients, antioxidants, vitamins, and fatty acids hydrate, replenish, and calm the skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Founded by Brazilian-born Francisco Costa, the longtime creative director of Calvin Klein, Costa Brazil celebrates the magic of the Amazon rainforest and the native ingredients within. Brimming with nut oils, plant butters, and superfruits, the potent body oil moisturizes, smooths, and brightens skin, and ends with a soft, velvety finish. But the true show-stopping ingredient is the brand's proprietary Jungle Complex, which is a trio of cold-pressed oils — kaya, cacay, and breu — that not only moisturize, but also strengthen the skin's texture to improve the look of fine lines, while rebalancing the skin tone to restore and enhance its natural luminosity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike many other options, the shimmer level here is faint and fine, but that's not to say non-existent, Instead, the brand continues it's theme of understated elegance as the translucent, nearly invisible oil flashes iridescent glimmers when it catches the light.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Kaya oil, cacay oil, Brazil nut oil, pataua seed oil, babassu seed oil, bacuri butter | <strong>Scent</strong>: Earthy and herbaceous |<strong> Size: </strong>100 ml</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-oil-summer-fridays-pool-time-glowing-body-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Oil</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Summer Fridays Pool Time Glowing Body Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Revolve Summer Fridays Pool Time Glowing Body Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/xtJYUG_geBACOaFrqsqTVrOU0tI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/summer-fridays-pool-time-glowing-body-oil-65fb57d96c6b4747b249caec12552dcb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Summer Fridays’ Pool Time Glowing Body Oil is constantly selling out, and it’s no mystery why. Made with a lovely blend of natural plant- and seed-based oils, including jojoba, apricot kernel and sunflower, it helps to keep your skin soft and moisturized all day long, all while the ultra-fine minerals deliver a fresh-out-of-the-sun shimmery golden glow that shines in the light.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And although this is a body oil, it doesn't feel like a traditional thick, goopy oil. Instead, it absorbs perfectly into the skin so you're not greasy, just decadently moisturized, two very important features in a great body shimmer. It’s also vegan, cruelty-free, and made using clean ingredients. As for the scent, all it's missing is an accompanying piña colada to pair with the tropical blend of coconut, vanilla blossom and warm almond, which also makes it an absolutely ideal pick for the warmer months (and for your long-awaited vacation).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Macadamia oil, jojoba oil, apricot kernel oil, sunflower oil | <strong>Scent</strong>: Warm vanilla and coconut |<strong> Size: </strong>3.2 oz</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bronzer-fenty-beauty-body-sauce-body-luminizing-tint></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bronzer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Fenty Beauty Body Luminizing Tint</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Fenty Beauty Body Sauce Luminizing Tint" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/GYRqOfh6sZpIdns94AQYBtVltjQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fenty-beauty-rihanna-body-sauce-body-luminizing-tint-585f87bcb4f24abe9cd3fa776326dcea.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Trust perpetually glowing queen Rihanna to come up with a dreamy body shimmer formula. “Fenty Beauty Body Sauce has a defined sparkle and melts into the skin, which is great for photos as it makes the skin look super luxe,” explains celebrity makeup artist Buster Knight, who has worked with the likes of Priyanka Chopra and Millie Bobby Brown. What makes this shimmer special is that it combines the sparkle with a touch of bronze to make instant liquid gold to help skin look healthy and radiant. And no Fenty product would be complete without a wide range of skin tones, and this one comes in seven shades, so you can highlight your skin tone without creating too much contrast. It also works wonders to blur imperfections and even out skin tone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike a majority of body shimmers on the market, this one comes in a handy gel cream formula, which makes it super easy to apply. It’s also enriched with healing babassu oil, which is derived from palm trees within the Brazilian rainforest. This oil instantly floods the skin with a heavy dose of antioxidants and fatty acids known for their anti-inflammatory properties, which can help soothe eczema and rosacea. Meanwhile, the nutrients from vitamin E work as moisturizing powerhouses to help relieve thirsty skin</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Perhaps most importantly, though, Body Sauce is formulated to be humidity-, sweat- and transfer-proof, making it the ideal pick if you’re planning to spend time in a hot and/or humid climate. Just one thing to keep in mind: It can be a little messy to apply and can take a (figurative) minute to sink into the skin, so make sure you have the time to let it dry completely before getting dressed, or you’ll risk it going everywhere.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Babassu oil, vitamin E | <strong>Scent</strong>: Vanilla |<strong> Size: </strong>95 ml</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-pale-skin-tom-ford-soleil-neige-shimmering-body-oil></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Pale Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tom Ford Soleil Neige Shimmering Body Oil</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1500 data-sizes=750px alt="Tom Ford Soleil Blanc Shimmering Body Oil" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dADaf4hAlZ9jNMe_WIx5GRTUjgY=/fit-in/1500x1500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tomfordsoleilblancshimmeringbodyoil-a75f6898dcad49d9999917f7c581129e.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tom Ford</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finding a body shimmer that works well with light skin tones can be a challenge. A tinted product runs the risk of your body looking much darker than your face, while an overdose of shimmer, especially the gold variety, can bring out yellow undertones. But the search can stop here: Tom Ford's shimmering body oil works beautifully with pale and light skin, creating a flattering, natural, and glossy radiance without adding too much pigment. With that in mind, this product is also totally suitable for all skin tones as well, including those with darker skin. It also helps to hydrate and soften the skin, thanks to a lovely blend of plant oils.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like any scented product, the fragrance can be polarizing. The aroma is typical Tom Ford: Sultry, floral, and spicy-sweet, courtesy of the cocktail of white florals, amber accords, and sandalwood. While we're head over heels for the captivating scent, others may want something lighter for a summer day. If you’re on the fence, Sephora sells this product in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">mini size</a> for a fraction of the price, which would make for a great introduction to it without the investment of the full-size bottle. And if you find the tint to be a little too light, give the deeper option, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Soleil Blanc</a>, a whirl.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Jojoba seed oil, olive oil, safflower oil | <strong>Scent</strong>: Floral and amber |<strong> Size: </strong>100 ml</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-no-transfer-sunday-riley-fairy-godmother-shimmering-body-oil-gel></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best No Transfer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sunday Riley Shimmering Body Oil Gel</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sunday Riley FAIRY GODMOTHER SHIMMERING BODY OIL GEL" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NRh2i8l5cHS29REeBKDF6Jf-Cf0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fairy-godmother-shimmering-body-oil-gel-63fa4d8ed6084e5680ea4d7b36aebb9b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sunday Riley</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sunday Riley is one of our absolute go-tos for skincare, but they’ve also totally nailed the glowing runway-ready aesthetic with the Fairy Godmother Shimmering Body Oil Gel. Unlike most others, this body oil does more than make you dewy and glamorous, it also helps improve the skin's tone and texture with the inclusion of vitamin C in the formula. This stable form of vitamin C visibly brightens skin, improves uneven pigmentation, and defends against free radicals. CoQ10, a largely unknown antioxidant found in all human cells, gets a hearty boost from the brand's proprietary protective blend, to support healthier looking, stronger skin, while gardenia extract envelops the skin in a layer of moisture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for the glow, it's a lovely sheen of soft, golden sparkle that skews more natural than disco ball — just remember to give it a good shake before you slather on. While the oil is super easy to spread all over, you have to work fast because it dries down in a flash (no seriously, this is the fastest-drying option on this list), and you will truly never need to worry about your clothes unwittingly acquiring a mysterious shimmer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Vitamin C, CoQ10, gardenia extract | <strong>Scent</strong>: No added fragrance |<strong> Size: </strong>100 ml</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lotion-bali-body-body-highlighter></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lotion</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bali Body Body Highlighter</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bali Body Body Highlighter" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/03G0pAVXy1QH1ldFU37JZLt-vhg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bali-Body-Body-Highlighter-6faef5dbc9884f5bbfcd2d7c40e14167.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bali Body</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don't Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Adenuga loves that this lotion from Australian-based brand Bali Body, which specializes in natural and vegan-friendly self-tan and sun-care products.

Infused with anti-inflammatory aloe vera, water-loving rosehip oil for supercharged hydration, and brightening caffeine, along with plenty of twinkling shimmer, it feels rich on skin, but doesn't create an oppressive layer of cream.

But we were totally surprised — and delighted — when the brand launched a body sunscreen with a generous SPF 40 that still doesn't feel gross and sticky, but also provides you a gorgeous glow. If you’re looking to trade in your regular no-shimmer, no-fun sunscreen for an extremely non-boring option, this product combines the two can make your life so much easier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of the biggest bummers about shimmer-laced products is the fact that they can easily irritate sensitive skin. However, this glowy sunscreen is layered with moisturizing emollients, like white stargrass and coconut alkanes, that also protect and strengthen the skin barrier. Even with all these strong ingredients, it still feels light and velvety, not at all greasy or heavy on skin.

This body oil is made from 97.7 percent natural ingredients, and 21 percent certified organic ingredients that are also harvested from organic farms and sustainable agriculture. To boot, it’s certified as a Natural and Organic Cosmetic by ECOCERT. It's totally safe even for the most reactive of skin types, as the formula is fragrance-free, GMO-free, vegan, and cruelty-free.

As for this gorgeous bespeckled body lotion, it's a terrific option for anyone looking for a nearly weightless option that feels like nothing on skin. “If you prefer a more lightweight option, an illuminating body lotion is an excellent choice,” says Adenuga. “Shea butter provides intense hydration, while coconut oil nourishes the skin, leaving it supple and soft.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Formulated to restore, brighten, moisturize and even out dull, dry and sensitive skin, this coconut and hibiscus lotion can even help to heal ashy areas in particular.

Adenoga suggests to try a lightweight, non-greasy formula, like a dry oil, first. “Look for products that are specifically designed to be transfer-resistant or mention this feature on their packaging,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although most people want a twinkling finish, she adds that applying any formula with abandon means that it will take longer to dry down and absorb into skin, which is a step that can never be skipped. If transfer is a serious concern for you (or your outfit), she suggests topping it off with a setting spray after it dries so the color and shimmer are locked in place. It's also a good idea to stick to smooth, breezy fabrics that are less prone to transfer, like silk, and steer clear of rough textures.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Tint<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Body shimmers can be tinted or not, and the choice is really yours as to which you prefer. “I love tinted body shimmer — it’s a great way to highlight your collarbones and shins on a night out while giving your skin a warm glow,” says Lozina. “Untinted body shimmer is fine too, and it comes down to personal preference and how pale you are. Some people love to rock their creamy alabaster skin, so in this case, I would avoid the tint and just use a body shimmer and no tint.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Similarly, those with darker skin may prefer to achieve a gorgeous glow without altering their skin tone, in which case an untinted product is the way to go.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Shimmer<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">How shimmery a product looks on your skin comes down to a few different factors, the most important being the shimmer's formulation and applicator. “Body shimmers come in all different formulations from body oils, creams, shimmer with tint, or no tint, powders shimmers that look like bronzers, finely milled flecks, or big, dramatic particles. It's all a personal preference,” says Lozina.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Think about how you're most likely to wear the body shimmer.

Or are you planning to slather yourself in gold for a bold, glossy radiance on a night out? There are plenty of both subtle and striking body shimmers, and just about everything in between, but when in doubt, it's usually best to start with a softer option first, because it can always be layered for extra oomph.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is the point of body shimmer?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Body shimmer is by no means an indispensable product, but it's a whole lot of fun, and who doesn't want to look luminous?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The whole purpose of a body shimmer is to give your skin a little glow without the harmful effects of tanning, especially since the sun is so damaging to our skin,” says Lozina. “Body shimmer is a healthy and playful alternative.

Let product air dry on your body and wait at least 5-10 minutes before dressing.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Iris Goldsztajn is a Paris-born, London-based freelance writer with 10 years of experience covering fashion, beauty, wellness and lifestyle for the likes of InStyle, British Vogue, Marie Claire, Cosmopolitan, Bustle, and Refinery29.
