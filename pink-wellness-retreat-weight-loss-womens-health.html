"I would work out three hours a day, eat clean, and my metabolism was a dud -- I couldn't get anything started. And I was like, 'I'm exhausted, I'm sad, I haven't been away from my family for three years -- not even overnight. And I just need a minute.'"</p><p>The Grammy winner traveled to SHA Wellness Clinic in Alicante, Spain, where she participated in a two-week program. During the two weeks, P!nk followed the Kushi diet, which, according to Women's Health, is an anti-inflammatory diet that consists of vegetables, beans and whole grains. The magazine added that P!nk's plan also included drinking apple cider vinegar combined with water. As per the diet, the "What About Us" singer also didn't drink liquids during meals.</p><p>P!nk -- who shares daughter Willow, 11, and son Jameson, 6, with husband Carey Hart -- reflected on her experience at the wellness retreat.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8456f306-d068-4680-9467-21519f0e283c data-container-ref=toofab:article:1f033cc2-6c1d-463f-b01c-3e930aa74786 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/35/5by4/2022/11/20/3509d86d99e64582bc36ea855451b6c0_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Carey Hart's 'Juicy Booty' Causes AMA Night Wardrobe Malfunction</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"It was the longest I've ever been away from my kids, and the biggest gift I've ever given myself," she recalled. "I did it for me, which in turn would be for them."</p><p>The "Try" singer revealed she lost weight during her time at the wellness treat, but didn't stop her health journey when she returned home. P!nk shared that she continued to follow several parts of the Kushi diet, while also re-introducing some foods she ate before.</p><p>Ultimately, the "So What" singer said working on her physical health and losing weight wasn't the main takeaway from her time at the wellness clinic.</p><p>"I got rest," P!nk said. "I wasn't getting rest before. I slept in a bed by myself for the first time in 11 years. I had time to meditate and cry and journal."</p><p>Check out P!nk's full Women's Health cover story, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><a id=gallery-link-e34e6752-39cf-4f86-9176-72cb3bb77f9c class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:e34e6752-39cf-4f86-9176-72cb3bb77f9c data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:1f033cc2-6c1d-463f-b01c-3e930aa74786 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d7/4by3/2023/12/21/d76ec4f7272348c49e7dd017dda4ff41_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2tmaXBfpbavt4ywnKWknprAtHnRnqurnZGperixyKCfrWWcpMC0edaopJ6mo2K1pq3LrZ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-amber-rose-is-just-not-that-into-bisexual-men-or-threesomes-video.html><span>←</span><span>Why Amber Rose Is Just Not That Into Bisexual Men -- Or Threesomes (Video)</span></a>
