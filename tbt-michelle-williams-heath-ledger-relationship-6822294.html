However, by 2007, the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dawson's Creek</a>&nbsp;alum and Ledger called it quits, just months before he died at 28 from an accidental overdose on January 22, 2008,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>reported&nbsp;People</a>.

Ledger plays closeted gay ranch hand Ennis Del Mar, and Williams was cast opposite the late actor as his wife and longtime love, Alma.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It was a case of love at first sight for Ledger and Williams — partly due to an on-set sledding accident.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The first day we filmed that scene where Michelle's character is on the toboggan and falls off the sled, and Ennis [Ledger's character] is with her — they're laughing; well on the third take, Michelle fell off the sled, and at the bottom of the hill she was crying," screenwriter Diana Ossana told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Out</a>&nbsp;magazine in 2015.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ossana continued, "She'd twisted her knee, and we had to call someone to take her to the hospital. Heath was not about to let her go alone, and as he was getting into the vehicle with her, he was smoothing her hair back."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I remember him looking at her, and she looking up at him with these wide eyes," Ossana added, "She was almost startled by the attention he was giving her, but you could see it every day from thereon.

He was so taken with her."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-december-2004-michelle-williams-and-heath-ledger-are-first-spotted-together></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>December 2004: Michelle Williams and Heath Ledger are first spotted together</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple was seen out for a stroll in Ledger's native Australia in late 2004.

"He liked to go out, he was a known user of drugs, he used cocaine. He had a lifestyle that really wasn't — at least in Michelle Williams's eyes — compatible with raising a child and continuing in that relationship. Even though their relationship did not work out, she did love Heath — she loved him very much."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Williams's best friend,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Busy Philipps</a>, also shed light on their "complicated" relationship in her 2018 memoir&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>This Will Only Hurt a Little</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[Heath] and Michelle were in the process of separating at this point," Philipps wrote,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>per&nbsp;People</a>, referencing her 2007 surprise wedding to Marc Silverstein.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Philipps added, "I felt sad for both of them, but weirdly, like something would be figured out, and it wasn't the end of the story for them. They were so young, and that baby was the light of both of their lives. They were just working all the time, and it was complicated. S—t is always complicated. Especially when you're 28.
