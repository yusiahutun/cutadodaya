Using a gel, a pencil, or a powder to style your arches is also an important step. But with so many options available in each category, how are you supposed to know what type of brow product to use, let alone how to apply it?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From arch to shape to fullness, all of these products exist to meet a wide range of brow concerns — and that's exactly what makes sifting through them all so overwhelming. So, should you be using a gel, a pencil, or a powder, and what is the difference between the three products, anyway? That's where the professionals come in. We turned to eyebrow specialists Joey Healy and Michele Holmes to break down the differences between these products, plus tips for how and when to use each one.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><ul><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Joey Healy</a> is an eyebrow specialist and the founder of Joey Healy Eyebrow Studio. He is also the creator of his eponymous eyebrow products collection.</li><li>Michele Holmes is an eyebrow specialist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Michele Holmes Studio</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Rye Beauty</a>.</li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for our expert-approved guide to using brow gels, brow pencils, and brow powders.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-brow-gel></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Brow Gel</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Think of brow gels as hairspray for your eyebrows. "Eyebrow gels hold your brows in place, allow you to style your brow in a visually pleasing manner, and give more hold to your brow hairs," Healy explains. "People use eyebrow gels to tame unruly hairs and give more shape to the brow."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brow gels can be clear, which are typically used to control the shape of the brows. Tinted gels, on the other hand, can make the hairs appear thicker in addition to holding them in place. "Tinted gels are miraculous for those with light or blond brow hair or those losing pigment — aka going gray — because they quickly deposit color, bringing your brows back to life," Holmes adds. "Many tinted gels also contain thickening agents or fibers to bulk up eyebrows, giving the appearance of three-dimensionally fuller, yet natural-looking brows."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-brow-pencil></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Brow Pencil</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A pencil allows for precise shaping of the brow and can be used to fill in gaps. "I’ve always found that pencils are good for specific holes, gaps, scars, and when you want a lot of accuracy or to work on the perimeter of your brow," Healy shares.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As far as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>brow products</a> go, a pencil is the most versatile. "Pencils are great because they can be used to create a variety of different looks; like a slick architectural look; a faux, fluffy brow; an ombré brow. It's all about how you lay down the product and blend out," Healy says. Two common methods of laying down the product include drawing fine, hair-like strokes or shading the entire brow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Holmes adds that there are two forms of pencils: manual sharpen or twist up. "Both versions are extremely user-friendly because their waxy or chalky qualities make them easy to blend and correct mistakes," she says.&nbsp;"Fine-tipped pencils are best for adding realistic looking hair, while wide-tipped or angled pencils are better for filling large areas or creating a fully designed set of brows."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-brow-powder></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Brow Powder</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brow powders come in a compact that looks similar to a pressed powder eyeshadow and are usually used to fill in the brows. "The look is incredibly soft and matte on the skin." The expert adds that brow powder is great for achieving the ombré trend where the powder is lighter in the front and darker on the tail.&nbsp;In addition to creating the illusion of denser brows, Healy says a powder creates the most natural finish. He recommends <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Joey Healy Luxe Brow Powder, Natural and Soft Definition Eyebrow Powder</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Also, when applying a brow powder, your brush matters. "An angled brush is used to apply powder, which pushes it onto the skin," says Holmes.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-choose-between-brow-gel-vs-brow-pencil-vs-brow-powder></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Choose Between Brow Gel vs. Brow Pencil vs. Brow Powder</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Personal Preference</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The type of product you use depends on your personal preference and the nature of your brows, Healy tells us. "Some people simply prefer pencils because they feel more comfortable with it as a familiar object."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The expert says pencils are great if you want to add detail and more structure to the existing brow. Gel is great for those with coarse hair or looking to achieve a no-makeup makeup look as they'll hold the shape in place. Lastly, powder can be beneficial for aging brows since it delivers a natural and pigmented finish.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Skin and Hair Type</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your skin type and hair type may also impact what type of brow product you use. "People with oily skin might have better success with a chalky pencil or power, while waxier pencils or liquid brow pens work best for those with dry skin," Holmes explains. "All skin types can use brow gels as long as there is visible hair to apply it to. Thicker hair might do better with a sheer tinted gel, whereas fine brow hair would benefit from a thick or fibrous gel to bulk up the hair in a three-dimensional way."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Match the Shade to Your Brows</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Above all, it's vital that you choose the right shade for your brows. "Look at the color of your natural brow and try to match the undertone – is it warm, cool, honey blonde, auburn?", Healy posits. "Don’t overdo it; less is more. If you’re between two colors, go with the slightly lighter one and build up the product.&nbsp;"<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-e25e638c-9638-4c34-a996-19e134ab4d59></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=51><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can you use brow gel, pencils, and powders together?</span></p><p>Sure, but you might find that your eyebrows are too dark for your liking.
