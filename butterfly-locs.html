This leaves it unexposed to breakage caused by the environment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another great thing about butterfly locs is that the messier they get, the better they look.

"I also recommend wrapping the edges of the hair with a silk or satin scarf and sleeping on silk or satin pillowcases," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Synthetic hair tends to draw the moisture out of the natural hair, so it's also good to have a spray bottle filled with jojoba oil and water to periodically spritz your locs and replenish the moisture of your natural hair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-way-to-wash-butterfly-locs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the best way to wash butterfly locs?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The best way to wash butterfly locs is to work gently and slowly: Focus the pads of your fingertips directly on the scalp without manipulating the shaft of the lock. "Just let the shampoo wash down the shaft of the loc while rinsing," says Courtney.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-know-when-its-time-to-remove-butterfly-locs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How do you know when it's time to remove butterfly locs?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If your scalp becomes itchy or irritated, or if the root of the natural hair starts to lock and dread, it's time to remove them. Also, if the style has become too fuzzy or messy for your desired look, it's time to say goodbye.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-way-to-remove-butterfly-locs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the best way to remove butterfly locs?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The best way to take them out is to cut the end of the loc and unravel the hair from the bottom," says Cortney. To prevent cutting your natural, she says to cut the loc a few inches below the end of your natural hair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-much-does-it-cost-to-install-butterfly-locs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How much does it cost to install butterfly locs?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The price of the butterfly locs depends on your location and the skill level of the hairstylist.
