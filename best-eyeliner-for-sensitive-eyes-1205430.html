So keep the following things in mind when purchasing eyeliner for your sensitive eyes.</p><p><strong>Highly-pigmented Eyeliners</strong></p><p>Always choose deeply pigmented eyeliners if you have sensitive eyes. Frequent touch-ups may irritate the eyes and cause you to tear up.&nbsp; Rich pigments in eyeliners ensure that they last a long time without fading, smearing, or drying out your eyes.</p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p><p>An essential but often ignored aspect of picking beauty products is the ingredients list. While you may not need to know exactly what goes in each eyeliner, it's ideal to look out for harsh chemicals that don't bother your eyes. Sensitive eyes can be affected by harmful chemicals, parabens, and sulfates used in some eyeliners. To protect your eyes from pain, dryness, and irritation, choose eyeliners without harsh ingredients. It is advised to choose vegan eyeliners.</p><p><strong>Color</strong><br>While the color of the eyeliner does not really affect the sensitivity of your eyes, it is better to pick a color that you would wear every day, if you fancy eyeliners with all your outfits. But don't limit yourself to just black eyeliner, there's a palette of eyeliner colors to choose from. You can add some vibrant colors to your makeup vanity.</p><p><strong>Water-resistant</strong></p><p>A water-resistant eyeliner is useful when it's raining (or when you're having an emotional breakdown). Pick an eyeliner that will stay put even if you have to jump into the pool or wipe off sweat after a kickass workout session. No matter what the weather or situation is, as fellow beings, we always hope your eyeliner is even and your foundation is perfect. So, an eyeliner that is waterproof won't budge until you take it off. It is also the best option for contact lens wearers and frequently watery eyes. You won't need to touch up dings throughout the day thanks to this.</p><p><strong>Thickness</strong><br>The consistency of eyeliners varies depending on the form they are in. Eyeliners are usually pencil, gel, or liquid. While a gel liner may be the thickest of all, a pen eyeliner is usually lightweight. The best eyeliners for sensitive eyes are always those that are lightweight, as they don't burden your eyes and make them feel droopy or heavy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Applicator:</strong></p><p>The type of applicator plays a pivotal role in determining how smoothly and comfortably the eyeliner can be applied. Opting for a soft and gentle applicator is vital to avoid any potential irritation or discomfort. Instead of traditional eyeliners that may have rough or stiff bristles, look for alternatives with soft and fine-tip brushes that prioritize sensitivity.</p><p>Quick Tip: Melissa Van Dijk, beauty blogger, and educator says, “​​While applying the eyeliner, try to look in the opposite direction so that you don’t see the pencil near your eyes. Don’t forget to pull the waterline away from the eyeball, especially while wearing contact lenses, so that the eye does not get irritated.” Sensitive eyes also tend to get ticklish and watery soon. “When tearing up, use a cotton tip towards the inner corner to dab at the tears,” Dijk says.</p><p>No matter which eyeliner you pick, regardless of its formulation, look for words and notes on the packaging that indicates that they are ophthalmologist- or dermatologist-tested. You can also check the ingredients list to see if synthetic fragrances have been added by scanning for words like "fragrance-free" and "hypoallergenic," which are other good indicators that the eyeliner you're hoping to buy will be gentle on your eyes. It is also essential that you remove your makeup with as much care as you put it on. Make sure you've removed every inch of your eye makeup before you hit the sack because any traces left behind can enter your eyes while you're sleeping and cause puffiness and redness the following day.</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Apply Eyeliner for Sensitive Eyes?</h2></p><p>Having sensitive eyes shouldn't stop you from achieving those stunning, defined eye looks you've always desired. In fact, it calls for a careful approach to ensure you flaunt your eyeliner without any discomfort. By adopting these gentle techniques specifically tailored for sensitive eyes, you can rock that glamorous look while keeping your delicate eyes feeling happy and irritation-free.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Prepping And Priming</strong></p><p>Start by cleansing your face using a mild, hypoallergenic cleanser. Gently remove any residue or oils that may be present around the eye area. This prepping step ensures that your skin is clean and ready to welcome the eyeliner.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, apply a hydrating and soothing eye cream specifically designed for sensitive skin. Look for ingredients like chamomile, aloe vera, or cucumber, known for their calming properties. Now, allow the cream to fully absorb, creating a protective barrier that will safeguard your delicate eye area throughout the application process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose the Perfect Product</strong></p><p>Sensitive eyes call for eyeliners that are both gentle and hypoallergenic. Opt for pencil eyeliners over liquid or gel formulas, as they tend to be less harsh on the delicate skin around the eyes. Additionally, choose eyeliners labeled "ophthalmologically-tested" or "safe for sensitive eyes."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you prefer a liquid eyeliner, go for water-based ones as they typically contain fewer irritants. Check for those that are alcohol and fragrance-free to further reduce the risk of irritation. Always remember to patch-test any new eyeliner product on a small area of your forearm or behind the ear before applying it directly to your eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 3: Application Techniques</strong></p><p>Now that your eyes are prepared and your ideal eyeliner is in hand, it's time to perfect your application technique. For a softer, more natural look, gently press the pencil eyeliner into the roots of your lashes, using short, feathery strokes. Avoid dragging the eyeliner across the lid, as this may cause discomfort or tugging. Instead, focus on building up the desired intensity gradually.&nbsp;</p><p>If you prefer a winged or cat-eye effect, start by drawing a thin line along the upper lash line using the pencil eyeliner. Then, using an angled eyeliner brush, smudge the line slightly upward and outward to create a subtle wing. This technique allows you to achieve the desired look while minimizing direct contact between the eyeliner and your sensitive eye area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 4: Post-application Care</strong></p><p>Once your eyeliner is applied, it's essential to complete the process by pampering your eyes with some post-application care. Begin by removing any excess product or smudges with a gentle makeup remover, specifically formulated for sensitive eyes.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Finding the best eyeliners for sensitive eyes is crucial to prevent any irritations or allergies.
