The <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> have been going from strength to strength recently, but they only publicly confirmed their relationship in September last year. <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> attended numerous NFL games – her beau plays for the Kansas City Chiefs – and since then they have packed on the PDA every chance they get! But their relationship isn’t probably at the ring-on-Taylor’s-finger level just yet.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1535512716-683x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-we-don-t-think-they-are-engaged>Why we don’t think they are engaged</h2><p>We think any rumors Taylor Swift and <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> are engaged are pretty ridiculous.</p><p>Taylor, 34, has been in relationships for much longer than her current one, such as her six-year romance with <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star Joe Alwyn. This makes us wonder if she would actually tie the knot with someone she has only been with publicly for four months.</p><p>Not to mention, the couple also aren’t yet living together yet – even if Ms Swift has had quite a <a href=#>few ex-lovers</a> in her time – they seem to be taking it slow.</p><p>Furthermore, the idea Travis would get down on one knee without telling a soul is questionable. Both Taylor and Travis are extremely close with their families, and so for them to take such a big step in secret is something we can’t believe.</p><p>Both Taylor’s mom and dad work with her, and <a href=#>she has written songs for her mom</a>, so a big personal event like getting engaged, and on a whim too, just doesn’t really make much sense to us.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rumors-of-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-being-engaged-emerge>Rumors of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce being ‘engaged’ emerge</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-24-at-15.57.02-1024x385.png><p>During an episode of the Duex U podcast, anonymous hosts discussed the latest rumor surrounding Traylor. A source informed them the two were set to tie the knot. The source claimed before they attended a private party where they locked lips to bring in 2024, Taylor and Travis decided they were going to get hitched.</p><p>One of the hosts said they “didn’t necessarily believe” Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce had become engaged. Nonetheless, the host shared what the source had told her.</p><p>She said: “Somebody tells me, ‘Pretty sure Taylor and Travis got engaged on 12/31. Did it just the two of them alone before they headed to that party where they were photographed.”</p><p>Taylor and Travis were seen at the party looking “happy.” But it was New Year’s Eve. We don’t think it was ‘we just got secretly engaged’ type of happy.</p><p>Lyric Sheree, who was in attendance, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Entertainment Tonight: “I view them as a fresh couple. So, it always gives good vibes when you’re starting out to date, and they look very happy. Taylor looked super happy.</p><p>“I didn’t feel any type of bad chemistry between those two. I feel like they’re a really cute couple, and they have good energy together.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Travis Kelce offered ‘free $1 million engagement ring’ for Taylor Swift</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-psychic-predicted-their-engagement>A psychic predicted their engagement</h2><p>Earlier this month, a psychic <a href=#>spoke exclusively to Celebrity Tidbit</a> and told us all about how he believes Travis and Taylor will become engaged sooner rather than later. Adam Norton believes the special moment for the <a href=#>music</a> star and sportsman will happen this year, too.</p><p>“Travis and Taylor I see working really well! An engagement I absolutely see on the cards, and it’s not too far away either!” he explained. “I keep seeing the night sky so potentially they’ll get engaged during the evening or a ring picture will be taken and put on social media during the evening…”</p><p>He continued: “But their relationship I do feel will continue to blossom into 2024. August / September and November / December will be very significant to Taylor and Travis’ relationship.</p><p>“She’ll have a ring on her finger by the end of 2024, without a doubt. I see their relationship moving/blossoming very quickly.”</p><p><strong>Celebrity Tidbit has gone to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s reps for comment.</strong></p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Taylor Swift fans will ‘never get over’ her custom-made Travis Kelce jacket</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eBcL7Upqarq12prrq4zqtkrK%2BZm8Furc2dZK2qkau2tHnKnqOcnV2cvLV5xKeemp%2BVmXq4scSkqmaZl6R6qr%2BMn6mappuhxm6%2ByJ2gnK2cpMK0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./boy-12-kills-bullied-cheerleader-html.html><span>←</span><span>Ronin Shimizu, 12, kills himself after 'he was bullied for being a cheerleader'</span></a>
