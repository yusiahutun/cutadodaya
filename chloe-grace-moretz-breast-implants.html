The 21-year-old actor—who has spoken out against <a href=# rel=noopener>Photoshop</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>body-shaming</a>—recently opened up about an on-set experience at 16 that almost led her to getting breast implants.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Sunday Times</a>, Moretz recalled working on a film when she was 16. After she was done filming, Moretz returned to her trailer where she found a push-up bra with silicone inserts left for her. Though no one explained why the bra was there, to Moretz, the message was clear.&nbsp;“I was, like: where did these come from?” Moretz said. “Those little things were insidious. Even though you can brush them off, you still internalize them. They make you question yourself and think: well, maybe I am unhappy with the size of my breasts.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/venusingemini_2.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/zoom-2.jpg><p>As someone who has grown up in Hollywood, Moretz, who started acting when she was 7, understands the pressure of looking “camera-ready” and knows that the pictures she sees from red carpets and on magazines aren’t necessarily a reflection of reality.&nbsp;“I’ve had to look at Hollywood my whole life,” Moretz. “The people I’ve been comparing myself to are people who are not real.”</p><p>From a costar <a href=# rel=noopener>who played her romantic interest and body-shamed as “too big”</a> to date in real life to the time that Moretz was <a href=# rel=noopener>photoshopped</a> when she was 15 years old, Moretz is well-aware of Hollywood’s impossible beauty standards. That’s why she’s speaking out, in hopes of changing them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHCDk3FqcGtfmLWtu8RmnquZk5p6rrvRnquzZZKnsqK%2F02agpqiclru1v44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gabby-windey-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who's Gabby Windey Dating?
