However, he didn’t keep it on for the entire duration of the time, as fans were able to admire his curly locks when he took it off.</p><p>With his mask, the 28-year-old was suited and booted in a smart, yet stylish gray blazer on top of an unbuttoned black shirt.</p><p>The premiere comes after Dune co-stars, Timothée and Zendaya, who have been great friends since filming the first installment of the <a href=#>movie</a>, recently admitted it was ‘weird as hell’&nbsp;to kiss.</p><p>“It’s definitely strange,” the Euphoria star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">admitted</a> to Entertainment Tonight. “I think both of us are just like, ‘All right. This is our job. OK, we’re going to do this.'”</p><p>“It’s weird as hell, ’cause we’re so close, platonically,” Chalamet agreed. “In the scope of the movie, it’s totally what is happening, but I also feel like we are so tight now that it really is just like another day at work.”</p><p>Zendaya is still going strong with Spider-Man co-star <a href=#>Tom Holland</a> since confirming their relationship in 2021. Chalamet has been seen kissing Kylie Jenner, but neither has outright confirmed the relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1983633174-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-dune-star-isn-t-the-only-celeb-to-cover-his-face-at-a-premiere>The Dune star isn’t the only celeb to cover his face at a premiere</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-468234333-1024x683.jpg><p>Chalamet is not the only <a href=#>celebrity</a> to ever ‘cover their face’ at a premiere. 10 years ago, in February 2014, Shia LaBeouf wore a paper bag on his head to the premiere of Nymphomaniac at the Berlin Film Festival.</p><p>The bag, had the words “I am not famous anymore,” written on it after an incident where he was accused of plagiarism.</p><p>At the time, he had recently released a short film on <a href=#>Twitter</a>, now known as X, which was said to have striking similarities to a work of fiction created by&nbsp;graphic novelist Daniel Clowes.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, the 37-year-old revealed he was “going through an existentialist crisis” at the time during an interview with Ellen DeGeneres.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WEcMDIpqatoJWaeqS0wKWYpp2kYrCwwsSrqmagmah6p63CnmSwoaSderTA0ZqloJ1drL%2Bmv9OloKefXaKutLeMmqtmnKWjsm5%2BjKmpnqWZmr%2Bmew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./databank-bogano-the-creature-asp.html><span>←</span><span>The Creature Force Echoes Location for Databank</span></a>
