And a sixth added: "Why is Rashford warming up wearing earrings, imagine SAF allowing that."</p><p>Fortunately for him, Rashford's earrings weren't picked up on by Roy Keane. The United legend-turned-Sky pundit did, however, call out the all-too-often poor performances he's produced this season.</p><p>Keane said: "His desire needs to change, his work rate - I don’t see him doing enough runs off the ball. He doesn’t get in behind, he needs to run more, to me he’s going through the motions.</p><p>"He had an amazing season last year, signed a new deal and you’re hoping he kicks on now, shows that maturity, those leadership skills, but I don’t see it.</p><p>"We know he’s got it in his make-up, but we need to see it more. You need to be consistent and we don’t know how these players are going to play week-in, week-out. That’s the most frustrating thing, especially for the manager."</p><p>Rashford went some way to answering Keane's pleas by putting United 2-1 ahead in the first half at Old Trafford. Richarlison's header had cancelled out Rasmus Hojlund's early opener.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Wopq2akaG5cLnAp2SurJRiuqK%2Bwq6qZqqRqLWnu9GdZJ6Zoqe2r7PSZmpqcGdugXN9</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fusion-arena-a-50-million-esports-arena-planned-for-philadelphia.html><span>←</span><span>Fusion Arena, a $50 Million Esports Venue, Planned For Philadelphia</span></a>
