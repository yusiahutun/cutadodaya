"The 2nd & 3rd photo capture the last time we were together while he was still alive. His mom Wendy would often press my hands to her cheeks & say, with a lulling sadness, “you have his hands”. She would breathe them in as if it were her only chance to hold him just a little bit closer, frozen in time. I hope she’s holding his hands wherever they are."&nbsp;</p><p id=eFSkz-vDSRh data-wc=39>She continued: "In the last 30 years my ideas around loss have been in a continuous state of metamorphosing. The biggest lesson learned through grieving for almost as long as I’ve been conscious, is that it serves a purpose.&nbsp;</p><p id=efy8ZiFi4C4 data-wc=64>"The duality of life & death, pain & joy, yin & yang, need to exist along side each other or none of this would have any meaning.

"I wish I knew the cadence of his voice, how he liked his coffee or the way it felt to be tucked in after a bedtime story. I always wondered if he would’ve caught tadpoles with me during the muggy Washington summers, or if he smelled of Camel Lights & strawberry nesquik (his favorites, I’ve been told)."&nbsp;</p><p id=eSONEoCPD58 data-wc=37>She added: "But there is also deep wisdom being on an expedited path to understanding how precious life is.
