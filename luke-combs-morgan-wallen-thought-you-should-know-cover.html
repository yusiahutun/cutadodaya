"Congrats again."</p><p>"Thought You Should Know" is part of the tracklist for Wallen's latest album, One Thing at a Time, but fans first heard it nearly a year before that project came out. A love ballad written from the perspective of a son to his mother, Wallen first put out "Thought You Should Know" around Mother's Day 2022 as a tribute to his mom, Lesli.</p><p>Later that year, he sent it to radio, where it topped multiple country charts.</p><p>Wallen co-wrote the song with <a href=#>Miranda Lambert</a> and Nicolle Galyon, and when it hit No. 1, it became Lambert's first chart-topper as a writer for another artist. Combs also has a connection to Lambert: The two stars sing a duet called "Outrunnin' Your Memory" on Combs' 2022 Growin' Up album, but Combs kept that song an album track, never sending it to radio.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 20 Luke Combs Songs That Prove 'Em All Wrong</h2><p>Check out Luke Combs' best songs, and the songs that changed his life when so many thought he wasn't good enough to be a country star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpa2bmnqku8ybqmaln6e0orqMsJilpJWjerW0zq6eoaxdrry2edKhpq6klGK4r7vWZpqorpWnfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shetland-star-ashley-jensen-husband-kenny-doughty-red-carpet-appearance-after-wedding.html><span>←</span><span>Shetland's Ashely Jensen and new husband Kenny Doughty make rare red carpet appearance following sec</span></a>
