<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>'The Bear' Season 3 News: Everything We Know</h1></header><section class=post-content><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=0 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">Season two of The Bear has finally arrived, with 10 new episodes transforming the fast-paced, stress-filled dramedy about a Chicago beef spot into an introspective, calming character study (which still features some heart-clutching moments). The first season of the FX series arrived on Hulu with a bang last summer, as critics and fervent fans propelled the show from a stealth word-of-mouth hit to numerous award nominations (including a staggering 10 Emmy Award wins this month alone). Months after the game-changing season-one finale, season two picks up right where the first left off, with Carmy (White) and his team attempting to open a new restaurant, The Bear, just 12 weeks after the closing of his late brother’s sandwich shop, the Original Beef of Chicagoland.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For those who have already torn through the entire second season, including that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a44335574/the-bear-season-2-ending-explained-finale-recap/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="heart-wrenching finale" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">heart-wrenching finale</a>, here’s what we know about the show’s future so far.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Has The Bear been renewed for a third season?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">FX has confirmed that The Bear will return for a third season in 2024 with filming set to begin in February or March of this year. The Bear is also a bona fide awards darling, and has received several nods for this year’s Emmy nominations.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What would season three of The Bear be about?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Season two ends on friends-and-family night, as the restaurant takes a big step toward opening to the public. It’s likely that season three will see the Bear finally open its doors, and hopefully, business will be booming, since Carmy, Sydney (Ayo Edebiri), and the team still have to pay Uncle Jimmy back. The show will also likely continue to explore themes of loss and living with grief.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The show's star Jeremy Allen White did share in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2023/film/podcasts/jeremy-allen-white-iron-claw-the-bear-season-3-1235810636/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a recent interview with Variety" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">a recent interview with Variety</a> that the series would return to a "functional kitchen atmosphere" a la season 1.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for how many seasons The Bear will last, showrunners Chris Storer and Joanna Calo told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2023/tv/features/the-bear-jeremy-allen-white-ayo-edebiris-season-2-1235475312/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Variety class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Variety</a> in January they have a road map for the entire series, but the duo are staying mum on how long they see the show going.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">When would season three come out?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Bear moves very quickly behind the scenes; after receiving a renewal a month after the series premiere, season two arrived after only a year-long hiatus. There’s a chance that the series could stick with its current pace, with season three arriving in summer 2024.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/81e105b4-86bd-4dab-a1f8-e00063b9e433_1609381211.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" title="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Quinci LeGardye is an LA-based freelance writer who covers culture, politics, and mental health through a Black feminist lens.
