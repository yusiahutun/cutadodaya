The 37-year-old owner, surnamed Lu, who operates four hotels in the city of Lijiang in China’s southwestern Yunnan province, said she changed one of the homestays into a haven for women travellers in June this year.
She told Chinese video outlet Souhu Qianliyan that she made the decision after a female guest had a romantic encounter at one of her hotels with a male guest who turned out to be a scam artist."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
