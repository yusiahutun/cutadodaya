I want to keep giving myself more opportunities and this is the route that I can do that.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So, I’m really focused, and trying to win the Order of Merit out here is my number one goal this year, and that’s all I’m really focused on.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ogletree is top of the Tour and International Series rankings thanks to an outstanding start to the season. He finished ninth in the season-opening PIF Saudi International and tied for seventh at last week’s International Series Oman.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I mean, confidence wise, I don’t know how I could get a lot higher. My last five starts internationally, four top-10s and two wins, so I think I’m playing really good golf,” he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m executing my game plan really well and kind of eliminating some of the silly mistakes.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s a far cry for a player who, hindered by a hip injury, struggled to make an impact when he turned professional in 2020 following a stellar amateur career.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The former Georgia Tech college golf star reached the pinnacle of the amateur game in 2019 when he won the US Amateur, and that same year was part of the victorious United States team at the Walker Cup.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said: “Yeah, I mean, obviously, just being able to play pain free is awesome. I’ve had a really good run the past few months, my body has felt great. I’ve never lost my confidence mentally. But now that I’m getting some reassurance from my body, it’s gaining even more confidence. So super pleased to be champion here. It’s unbelievable.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What a great test we had this week. It was really hard. The course got really firm and fast, there was so much wind. I grew up playing in no wind, so super proud to win a golf tournament in wind like this.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/02/20/2d8ed68b-269d-4baa-9933-1d1b45036e2c_9a7642c7.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Gunn’s finish was his best on the Asian Tour since he came third in the Hong Kong Open at the beginning of 2020. He has also been struggling with injuries over the past few seasons.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t know what to say, it’s been a while since I started playing well again and could say that all the credit goes to my coach Sam Cyr,” said Gunn, who has been playing on a medical exemption.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We’ve been working really hard for the past six months and this has been the first time that he’s come out here and working with me. We really did grind it out during the practice days, and he put me in the present moment throughout the weekend, encouraged me throughout the whole day and you know, don’t put my head down.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The next event on the Asian Tour is the New Zealand Open, which will be played at Millbrook Resort from March 2 to 5.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1moKecm3yivtOimqWdX2h%2FcnyXbmhomaOerq9506isq2WRo7GzsdZmpqCklam%2FprGMmpudq12mrrWt0Wagp6yVp7uiwMiopZqkXaiys7XErGStqpmqurG00maqmrGjYruwec6nnGavkaPBtHnIrWSmp6Kaeq6x</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chicken-coops.html><span>←</span><span>18 Best Chicken Coop Kits for Sale</span></a>
