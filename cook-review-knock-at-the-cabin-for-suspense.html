“Knock at the Cabin” is based one someone else’s work – namely, author Paul Tremblay’s “The Cabin at the End of the World.” It has Shyamalan’s atmosphere, but not the twist ending his fans – and I’m among them – expect.
Without going into too much detail so I can prevent spoilers, the woefully under-seen “Take Shelter” is in this film’s cinematic DNA."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Jonathan Groff and Ben Aldridge play a couple with an adopted daughter, Wen (Kristen Cui.) The three are on vacation at a cabin out in the woods when a fellow named Leonard (Dave Bautista) approaches Wen outdoors.</p><p>He seems friendly enough, but things take a turn for the sinister pretty quickly.</p><p>He brings with him three other people (including Redmond, played by a very grownup Rupert Grint)&nbsp; who bring weapons along with them. The intruders terrify the little family while Leonard keeps talking about the importance of making a decision&nbsp; – whatever that means – and how time is running out. The four are messengers, Leonard claims, and they are on hand to announce that one member of the invaded family must serve as a sacrifice.</p><p>Who ARE these people? &nbsp;Are they members of some cult who share a delusion? Do they mean what they say about sacrifice?</p><p>You – along with the family members – will be trying to figure that out as the pace picks up speed in this film that transcends genre.</p><p>The performances are enjoyable all the way around while you may ask yourself just what the heck you would do if you found yourself in this quandary.</p><p>The final few seconds are unexpected, simple and powerful, and express a lot without the use of dialogue.</p><p>Shyamalan fans, and those with a Christian background, probably will enjoy this more than newcomers to his movies.</p><p>Rated: R for foul language and violence.</p><p>Running time: 100 minutes.</p><p>At Cinemark, Davenport; Regal, Moline; and Palms 10, Muscatine. &nbsp;</p><p>Watch the trailer <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.knockatthecabin.com/videos/>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXnNnq6sZ52kw6qx0miaqKebYr%2BmwsiermajnqSwrHnArWStoJVisKKuyKdkn6eiYsC2v8%2BepaydXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./where-is-dr-nicole-arcy-now.html><span>←</span><span>Where is Dr. Nicole Arcy now?</span></a>
