For instance, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index launched in 2001 includes Brazil, China, India, South Korea, Malaysia, Qatar and even three countries in the European Union.China, which boasts the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">largest and fastest</span></a> rail network in the world, has more than 5,300 companies listed on its mainland stock markets.

This is comparable to America, where the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq combined have about 6,000 companies listed – and where equity trading goes back more than 230 years.Meanwhile, “emerging market” South Korea has, for decades, toyed with the top spot of being the most internet-linked country in the world, helped by Samsung and LG – and let’s not forget the global cultural phenomenon that is <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">K-pop</span></a>.We are told that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Qatar</span></a> is still emerging even though it is the eighth-richest country in the world by gross domestic product per capita, according to International Monetary Fund data, showing that this metric, as a measure of country development, is fatuous.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The US, recognised as a developed economy, came in at sixth place, while others such as Britain, at 21st, and France (23rd) rank below Qatar.</p>The only reason that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">China and India</span></a> are not in the top 25 is because of their huge populations, each about four times America’s.

The poor are visible on the streets, or invisible in damp, unhealthy social housing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If you are going to be struggling financially, you might be happier in a rural rather than an urban environment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Alternatively, post-development implies fewer raw struggles, a richer life, free time for creativity, and state and community support for the disadvantaged.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China’s urbanisation efforts draw to a close for most provinces and cities</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Developed countries have a legacy of wealth and value – a source of pride from developing times, such as the wondrous churches of Italy, the grand buildings of Barcelona and Granada, the social construct of the British or the Swiss, artworks in the Louvre, and the great engineering works of America.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A healthy historical perspective combined with long years of formal education helps with daily problem-solving.

It is outmoded, outdated and patronising for China, India, South Korea and many others. It hinders China in projecting its leadership and strength when seeking to provide aid, influence and support to countries in the Global South; those on the “periphery”.
