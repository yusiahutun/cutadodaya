Another good example: Canadian rock band Nickelback.</p><p>While never critically acclaimed (or particularly good, for that matter), the band has sold millions of records and have achieved commercial success. Still, they can’t seem to catch a break, becoming reduced to little else than a punchline during the last few years. Have they done anything truly offensive? No. They’re just lame, which is hardly reason enough to bear the brunt of society’s hatred.</p><p>Obviously, people are always going to have opinions about celebrities (they are celebrities, after all) and often, the public’s overwhelming distaste certainly is&nbsp;justified.</p><p>Take, for example, <strong><a title="Why The Onion’s Angry New Article About Chris Brown Beating Rihanna Is Not&nbsp;Okay" href=#>Chris Brown</a>. </strong>It’s not hard to see why society views him in a such a negative light: <a title="Why The Onion’s Angry New Article About Chris Brown Beating Rihanna Is Not&nbsp;Okay" href=#>Brown was&nbsp;convicted of assault after beating up his on-and-off girlfriend </a><strong><a title="Why The Onion’s Angry New Article About Chris Brown Beating Rihanna Is Not&nbsp;Okay" href=#>Rihanna</a>, </strong>who has since forgiven him (and that’s the abridged version of events!) Now, there’s a legitimate reason to really hate a celebrity—but not liking someone’s “horse mouth” just isn’t.</p><p>In honor of the Hathaway hatred that infiltrated the zeitgeist earlier this year, we’ve compiled a slideshow of 10 of the most irrationally hated celebrities today—and shared why people seem to feel this way.</p><p>Click through the slideshow above to see who made the cut!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2idnqmys8DAoqWmnZ6pfHKDknBwbmeRo7umeceaq6GZp5bGbrrInKKepJKWsKx5kGlkoqqilsGqu82ao6WxXZ2utbHDZpqepJWXv6rAyJ6qaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pastor-nick-davis-grace-point-church-las-vegas-joe-junio-shooting-html.html><span>←</span><span>Las Vegas realtor Joe Junio 'filmed shooting pastor Nick Davi dead in front of his family' posted st</span></a>
