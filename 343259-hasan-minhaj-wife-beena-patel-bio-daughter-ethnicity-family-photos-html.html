The majority of the pictures are lovely, both standing next to one another, gestures expressive of their intimate affection. Are you wondering how they created such a marvellous union?</p><p class=align-left>The couple's first interaction was when they were studying at the University of California, Davis. From the first moment Hasan Minhaj saw Beena, he had a massive crush on her, not knowing that one day she would be his wife.</p><p class=align-left>Hasan pursued her interests, and the two dated for a few years before tying the knot in 2015. Out of respect for their culture, the couple did not move in together until they were married. Since both of them had different religious affiliations, they were not sure about the dominant theme for their wedding. Hasan Minhaj is a Muslim, while Beena Patel is Hindu.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5886fa324be59c63.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nabayet: interesting facts about Otile Brown's Ethiopian lover</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Nonetheless, their love prevailed, and they were allowed to marry following traditional Indian customs.
