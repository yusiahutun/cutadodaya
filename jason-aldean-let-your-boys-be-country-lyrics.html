"It's like, 'Man, just let 'em be kids. Let them be little. Let them go play and do all the things they're supposed to do and figure things out for themselves.'"</p><p>That's more or less what his followup to "Try That&nbsp;in a Small Town" is about, although the lyrics to "Let Your Boys Be Country" follow&nbsp;a boy's journey to manhood. Southern manners, a want to be outdoors and pride for county and country are a few other touchstones of this mid-tempo waltz.</p><figure class="img-tag has-sizer aligncenter" readability=2><p><span class=visually-hidden>attachment-Let Your Boys Be Country</span></p>Broken Bow Records<p>loading...</p></figure><p>"Little boys grow up to be men that are supposed to get married and take care of their family and be providers," Aldean adds, talking to Taste of Country Nights host Evan Paul. "As parents, you gotta raise 'em to be that. To me, it was a song that hit home when it comes to thinking about him being little and what's in store for him later."</p><p>Aldean only has one son among his three daughters, so his plea will be to "Let our boy be country." Don't expect that to change, as the singer says he's 100 percent done fathering children.</p><p>"I always tell my wife, if you have a different baby, it's going to be with a&nbsp;different husband. I am out of the game."</p><h3>Here Are the Lyrics&nbsp;to Jason Aldean, "Let Your Boys Be Country":</h3><p>Let your boys be country / Let 'em keep that red dirt on his boots / Make 'em proud of that middle nowhere he's got down in his roots / Let 'em work in a hayfield sweating for a little summer cash / Raise 'em hard, raise 'em tough / Bring 'em up to have their brother's back.</p><p><strong>Chorus</strong><br>Let 'em ride 'round in trucks, making backroad noise / Let 'em hang out on Friday, getting wild with the boys / Let 'em go to the woods in the cold painted up camo green / Yeah, let 'em chase, let 'em fall for a small-town girl / Let everything inside these county lines be his whole world / You want him to grow up to be someone he's damn proud to be / Mamas, let your boys be country.</p><p>Teach 'em Yes, ma'am and No, ma'am / And never turn down a cold beer / Tell 'em there ain't nothing greener than the grass he's standing on right here.</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus</strong></p><p>Yeah, let 'em chase, let 'em fall for a small-town girl / Let everything inside these county lines be his whole world / You want him to grow up to be someone he's damn proud to be / Mamas, let your boys be country.</p><p>Let 'em ride 'round in trucks, making backroad noise.</p><p>Let 'em hang out on Friday, getting wild with the boys.</p><p>Let 'em go to the woods in the cold painted up camo green.</p><p>Mamas, let your boys be country.</p><p>Let your boys be country.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 50 Jason Aldean Songs: His Greatest Hits + Best Deep Cuts</h2>The best <a href=#>Jason Aldean</a> songs are spread out among his 11 studio albums.
