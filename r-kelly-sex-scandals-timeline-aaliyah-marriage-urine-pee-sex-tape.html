Kelly 'Cult' Report Grosses Out Twitter: 'Disgusting,' 'Horrifying'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>1. That time he illegally married a 15-year-old Aaliyah</h2><p>When Kelly was 24, he produced 12-year-old Aaliyah's first album, "Age Aint Nothin But A Number." The duo didn't have a romantic relationship at the time, but a few years later, <a href=#>he married the budding R&B star</a> when she was just 15 and falsified a marriage certificate to claim she was 18. The marriage was annulled in 1994 and the two stayed hush-hush about the incident from then on.</p><p>In a 2016 interview with <a href=#><strong>GQ</strong></a>, Kelly was asked if he was ever in love with Aaliyah, to which he said, "Well, there's a lot of ways to be in love with a person. I was in love with my grandfather, you know. But yeah, I would say I was in love with Aaliyah just like I was in love with anybody else. But in a different, friend type of way."</p><h2 class=h2>2. That time he had sex with (a few) minors</h2><p>Kelly allegedly had a sexual relationship with 15-year-old Tiffany Hawkings, who filed a lawsuit against the singer in 1996, <strong><a href=#>MTV News</a></strong> reported. During the trial, it was revealed that Kelly had also engaged in sexual relations with Hawkings' 14-year-old friend. The lawsuit was settled for $250,000, and Kelly was cleared of the charges.</p><h2 class=h2>3. That time he urinated on a minor in a 27-minute sex tape</h2><p>An x-rated home video surfaced in 2002 where Kelly is allegedly seen urinating on his partner. More specifically (and disgustingly), in her mouth. The young lady in the video was allegedly a minor, but her identity was never revealed. 21 charges, including child pornography, were reduced to 14 when he <a href=#>finally went to trial</a> in 2008, after which he was declared not guilty.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7197aaed-897b-5822-b413-be9ebcff6b55 data-container-ref=toofab:article:b9d4c8e2-9c3f-5785-9516-f90ec431cd4f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b4/5by4/2017/07/17/b4aba51fc0a15e05b575105bbfcff9f6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">7 Craziest Details From R. Kelly 'Cult' Report: Sex Tapes, Abuse and Jogging Suits</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>4. That time he allegedly knocked up a high schooler and paid for her abortion</h2><p>In 2002, Patrice Jones filed a $50,000 lawsuit against Kelly, accusing the singer of picking her up the night of her prom in 1998 when she was just 16, impregnating her over the course of their 9-month relationship, and then paying for her to have an abortion. Jones estimated they had sex 20-30 times before she turned 17.</p><p>"Kelly took advantage of his occupation or status, position of authority, and plaintiff, Patrice Jones, had trust and confidence in him to cause her to develop a dependent relationship in him," <strong><a href=#>MTV News</a></strong> reported the suit read.</p><p>Kelly settled the dispute out of court and denied wrongdoing.</p><h2 class=h2>5. That time he recorded a sex tape without telling his partner</h2><p>Another woman named Montina Woods came forward to in 2002 claim that Kelly had recorded them having sex, without her knowledge. According to <strong><a href=#>E! News</a></strong> the recording that Kelly made was added to "R. Kelly Triple-X," a complication sex tape created and sold by bootleggers.</p><p>"R. Kelly Triple-X" is also reported to show Kelly engaging is sex with another 14-year old as well, alongside various other clips that the singer claims are all falsely created.</p><p>Montina settled the lawsuit against Kelly outside of court, and all charges were dropped.</p><h2 class=h2>6. That time he dated a 19-year-old at the ripe age of 49</h2><p>In the "not illegal, but still uncomfortable" category, Kelly raised more eyebrows in 2016 for having a public relationship with 19-year-old Halle Calhoun. According to <strong><a href=#>The Daily Beast</a></strong>, the couple was seen out and about at Kelly's concerts and club appearances. The status of their relationship at the moment, however, is unknown.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:407be529-4d50-5fd6-aee2-b111491eda8d data-container-ref=toofab:article:b9d4c8e2-9c3f-5785-9516-f90ec431cd4f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a3/5by4/2017/07/11/a3ae3ca5087f5ddaa5c72adcca946adc_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Williams Rails Against 'Motherf--kers' Criticizing His Divorce</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>7. That time he was sued for breaking up a marriage</h2><p>Deputy Kenneth Bryant from Mississippi penned a lawsuit against Kelly alleging that he was the reason that he and his wife, Asia Childress, ended their marriage. <strong><a href=#>ET</a></strong> reported that Bryant claims that Kelly had been engaging in sexual relations with his wife for many years which led to the end of their relationship.</p><h2 class=h2>8. That time he started a sex "cult"</h2><p>Kelly's <a href=#>most recent sex scandal</a> comes from concerned parents who fear he has "brainwashed" young women (all of legal age of consent, at least) into a "cult," in which he allegedly monitors their every move, verbally and physically abuses them, makes them wear jogging suits to hide their figure from other men, and is apparently still recording his sexual escapades. <strong><a href=#>BuzzFeed</a></strong> confirmed parents' concerns with three women, including Kelly's former personal assistant, who were once in Kelly's inner circle and witnessed the weirdness from the inside.</p><p>“You have to ask for food. You have to ask to go use the bathroom," Cheryl Mack, his former assistant, said of Kelly's manipulation. "He is a puppet master."</p><p>Linda Mensch, a civil lawyer in Chicago who represents Kelly, released the following statement: "We can only wonder why folks would persist in defaming a great artist who loves his fans, works 24/7, and takes care of all of the people in his life. He works hard to become the best person and artist he can be. It is interesting that stories and tales debunked many years ago turn up when his goal is to stop the violence; put down the guns; and embrace peace and love. I suppose that is the price of fame. Like all of us, Mr. Kelly deserves a personal life. Please respect that."</p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ec/o/2017/07/13/ec1eb3afa2b25b89a9ab296e1286e6c7_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnh7j3Bmam9fp3qssculsGarla16tK%2FAp5uapKNiwaq5xKWgp51dlq6ttdian2alkae%2Fqq3GnmSuqpmjsm68xJ5krJ2oYsGivMRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cook-review-knock-at-the-cabin-for-suspense.html><span>←</span><span>Cook review: Knock at the Cabin for suspense</span></a>
