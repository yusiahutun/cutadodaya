Zeke was Justin Russo’s (David Henrie) best friend and despite being quite a big part of the series, he didn’t receive a call to rejoin the cast for a reboot. However, he told TMZ he wasn’t surprised by the fact due to the turn his career took after he left <a href=#>movie</a> and TV acting.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-120594784-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-that-s-all-on-me-i-totally-get-it-says-dan-about-wizards-of-waverly-place-snub>‘That’s all on me, I totally get it,’ says Dan about Wizards of Waverly Place snub</h2><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> explained he left acting to become an “adult content creator” after not having much success in the entertainment industry once the show had wrapped. But he said he doesn’t exactly expect his phone to start ringing for the Wizards of Waverley Place reboot.</p><p>He joked producers may have considered bringing the character of Zeke back only to discover what he now does for a living.</p><p>“I think it’s super exciting that the fans get to relive their childhood again and the old characters that they used to love watching are coming back,” he laughed. “</p><p><strong>MORE</strong>: <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan ‘hurt’ by joke at her expense in new Mean Girls movie</a></p><p>I love the premise, like the new idea they’re doing for the show. The other side of me is very sad because I know for a fact I will not be a part of it.</p><p>Dan was very quick to point out that the fact he probably wouldn’t return was “all on me.”</p><p>“I made choices so it’s like I put the chance of bringing back the character I played away when I decided to go along the path of being an adult content creator. I’m very conflicted,” he continued. “I’m like super happy and also just like ‘Dang it!’ Yeah, it’s a mix of emotions for me right now.”</p><p>He said he “liked to imagine” Disney producers finding out what he does for work these days. “I like to image that in the production meeting, the first production pitch meeting they had or whatever, someone in the room didn’t know,” he said smiling. “They were like ‘Oh we can even bring Zeke back!’ and someone in the rooms like ‘Oh, you don’t know … Oh no,'” he laughed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wizards-of-waverley-place-reboot-announced-by-disney>Wizards of Waverley Place reboot announced by Disney</h2><p>After not being on our screens for over 10 years, David announced the Wizards of Waverly reboot on his <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>Sharing a picture of the pilot episode’s script and Justin’s wand, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">penned</a>: “The Russo’s are excited to become a part of your family, once again, but we’ve grown [smiling face emoji]” 2024, the year magic comes back!

Audiences will see him living with his wife and two sons. Selena will guest star and the <a href=#>music</a> star is said to be an executive producer.
