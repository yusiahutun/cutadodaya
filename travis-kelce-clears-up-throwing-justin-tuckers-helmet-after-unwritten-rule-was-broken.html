At the time, people assumed the athlete was in the zone before the big AFC Championship game and that the clash was part of it. But on his <a href=# rel=nofollow>latest</a> podcast episode, New Heights, which he does with brother <a href=#>Jason Kelce</a>, Travis has a simple explanation for throwing the helmet.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chiefs-and-ravens-tensions-were-high>Chiefs and Ravens’ tensions were high</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1971279267-1024x683.jpg><p>The tight end was filmed throwing Tucker’s helmet to one side when it was in the way of buddy and fellow player Patrick Mahomes. Travis Kelce was just making sure it wasn’t in the way of the Quarterback, who was getting in some decent warm-up time before the big game.</p><p>It’s reported Trav also asked Tucker to move out of the way, according to NFL Network’s James Palmer.</p><p>Fans were quick to judge the 34-year-old for shouting over his shoulder at the Ravens star when he walked past Mahomes who was kneeling.</p><p>When Tucker didn’t appear to move, Travis Kelce made the decision to move his helmet, which was lying on the edge of the end zone. He threw the two footballs out of the way as well.</p><p>Commentators say the clash between members of the Chiefs and Ravens as they were practicing was down to the tensions running high. Apparently, Mahomes was later seen kicking Tucker’s stand out of the way when attempting to practice, as well as Marquez Valdes-Scantling doing the same to another. Also, Ravens cornerback, Arthur Maulet was spotted exchanging words with some Chiefs players and had to be held back by an official.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-explains-why-he-threw-tucker-s-helmet>Travis Kelce explains why he threw Tucker’s helmet</h2><p>In their latest podcast episode, the Kelce brothers sat down to discuss the latest in Football. Of course, they had to talk about the Chiefs huge win against the Ravens, which sees them head into the Super Bowl to face the 49ers.</p><p>But Jason brought up the clip that was widely-debated online, showing Travis Kelce throwing the helmet and appearing to look a bit annoyed.</p><p>Trav, who has been dating <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> since September, explained each team has their ‘side’ of the field during warm-ups. This is so everyone has enough room to practice kicks, throws, and exercises.</p><p>He continues that do switch and allow both teams to have a go at both end goals, in case wind speed, and other things raise any variations.</p><p>But Tucker apparently was in the Chiefs area despite the ‘unwritten’ rule, which annoyed the <a href=#>celebrity</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-don-t-be-a-d-about-it>‘Don’t be a d*** about it’</h2><p>Jason asks: “Justin Tucker is warming up and there’s an exchange between you and him, and also an exchange between Pat and Justin Tucker before that as well during warm-ups?”</p><p>“It wasn’t even that,” Trav starts. “So we’re warming up and we do our same warm-up every single time on our side of the field.</p><p>“For those of you that don’t know what happens in pre-game, the Ravens have their side of the field and the Chiefs have our side of the field. Now, specialists because of the wind factor and etc they get a chance to kick at both field goals and kind of punt from both sides of the field.</p><p>“If you’re trying to go onto the other team’s designated area, you kind of stay out of their way, you know. You don’t interfere with what they have going on.”</p><p>“That is the unwritten rule,” Jason chimes in.</p><p>“That is the unwritten rule,” Travis agrees. “If you want to be a f******g d*** about it, you keep your helmet and football and kicking tee right where the quarterbacks are warming up.</p><p>“Eyes are looking left and they got a helmet by their feet.”</p><p>Jason states: “It’s actually quite dangerous, really.”</p><p>“If you’re not going to pick that up, then I’ll pick that up for you,” the 34-year-old adds. “Justin came out in a joking gesture, being competitive, and winking at me, being a d*** about it, trying to get under the skin.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2h%2BcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGaapZ2Rp8Buwc9mq6Gqn6y2r7OMo6ysrJmjerXBwqScq6tdnbKtucStZJqepJq%2FbsHNsKmirKSau26%2B1KWcZq%2BRqHqjvs6knKdn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./article-59ce175e-619f-11ec-8a8c-e73b5ddd9829-html.html><span>←</span><span>Susan Howell Chancellor McKeithan | Obituaries</span></a>
