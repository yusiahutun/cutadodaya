CelebrityAccess has learned that layoffs are plentiful (“just about everyone” according to a source) and has learned the names of some of the individuals but will not report them – however the layoffs affect at least the graphics department, executive staff and subscription sales."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Jon Guynn has also joined OVG as VP of operations (and was in on the exit interviews).</p><p>Staff is also expected to be added to Pollstar’s London office and, apparently whatever the New York office is (OVG has just announced that&nbsp;it has an office in New York).</p><p>Gary Smith, who just recently was named CEO of Pollstar by its board of directors, will remain on in an “executive advisory capacity.”&nbsp; Smith has had a contract to work at Pollstar for several more years. Bongiovanni, however, who began the company about 35 years ago literally on his kitchen table, will move on to retirement.</p><p>The OVG statement says, “These changes … will necessitate staffing transitions and reorganization. Pollstar’s editorial, technology, and box office staff, the latter two led by CTO Dan Martin and Box Office Manager Brad Rodgers (sic), respectively, will remain largely unaffected, as will&nbsp;Pollstar’s London operation.”</p><p>The staff was about 50.</p><p>It’s hard to say what will happen with the office, filled with hundreds of concert posters submitted for Pollstar’s annual poster contest, if so many people are not going into it tomorrow. Neither of “the Garys” were in the office May 31, CelebrityAccess has learned.</p><p>Last summer, Oak View Group CEO Tim Leiweke came to the Fresno office to talk to the staff.</p><p>“First and foremost we’re buying the company,” he told the staff. “Second, because I know this is&nbsp;the No. 1 question I’d have if I were you: We’re not moving the company. The company will stay in Fresno. You will all continue to work at this company and we will continue to grow the company.”</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZoVwfJRoampnkqeyorfIp55mqJ%2BhubTAwKtkraddory3sYytpmakn6h6orrGnqOeq18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./article-babe1ba8-a561-11ec-b712-3fefc2278f97-html.html><span>←</span><span>Lawyer on wrong side of law gets suspended | Free News</span></a>
