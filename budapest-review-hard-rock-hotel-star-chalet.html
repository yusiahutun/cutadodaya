From the comfort of your pristine and spacious room, gaze out onto the streets of the idyllic city, enjoy a joyously large bed (couples - no need to squabble over sides here), submerge yourself into the soothing charcoal-walled showers or take advantage of the high tech features the room possesses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c3d7be905bd7-buda-1-z.jpg><p id=eCPRA3sEIqC7 data-wc=47>Fancy a snug winter soirée without having to go too far?
