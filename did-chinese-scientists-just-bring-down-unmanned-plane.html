Wen and colleagues said that the weapon operated within a narrow band, which means the microwave beam it generated was designed to give it a longer firing range.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although the experiment only involved one aircraft, they said the weapon would have “a significant advantage against swarms of drones”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Given the limited energy available on a battlefield, EMP weapons need to find ways to ensure that high-voltage bursts can be released as quickly as possible to be effective.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2021/04/22/clean.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">00:46</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Scannable QR code appears in sky above China’s Shanghai</p><p>Scannable QR code appears in sky above China’s Shanghai</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Researchers in China and other countries have long used <span class="c2 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1>a simple device known as the Tesla coil to amplify the voltage with the help of a magnetic field.</span></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But in recent years they have switched to a capacitor-based device known as a Marx generator to produce electric currents with up to two million volts, considerably higher than those generated by a Tesla coil, according to Gao and colleagues.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Though the highest reported output power around the world was about 20 gigawatts, Gao and colleagues said their calculations suggested the peak performance of the best American EMP weapons such as Thor could be as high as 80GW, adding that upgrades would get Chinese weapons close to that level.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Chinese EMP weapons are based on the design of their American counterparts, but with some technical innovations to achieve a high performance for a relatively low cost, according to the researchers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelny0r8iepZydX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2Fpg3SEj2ibopxdmLWqusSsnGark56yr8DIrKusZZqqwLV5waugp59dmby4uoyupaaZnqOypXnPpZinnQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chanel-pop-up-new-york.html><span>←</span><span>Chanel to Open Pop-Up Boutique in New York That's All Red Everything</span></a>
