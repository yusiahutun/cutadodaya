Yet, while the love of the hunt and finding a cool design may be your main focus, you could find yourself repelled by some of your picks for seemingly no reason at all. The answer, however, is pretty simple: energy — particularly the energy of its previous owner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It may seem a little out there, but the truth is that energy can attach to everything, and despite not being able to see it, we can definitely sense it. Once that piece of vintage jewelry is on our body — even if it's coming from a relative or loved one rather than a random shop — it might not feel quite right. The previous wearer's energy may not mesh well with your own, and it could even end up interfering with&nbsp;your vibrations and mood.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cleansing vintage jewelry of that old, "haunted" energy ensures that you can enjoy your beautiful, new-to-you accessory&nbsp;without&nbsp;having to worry about any bad vibes attached to it. Here are the best — and easiest — ways to do it.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-salt-water></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Salt Water</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Salt water is a natural cleanser and purifier. If you can't get to the ocean or sea to place your jewelry in the water for half an hour, you can create your own at home with epsom or table salt and water. Then, let the jewelry soak in a cup of salt water for 30 minutes. This will separate anything attached to the jewelry that should not be there, thus allowing you to feel comfortable with these pieces on your body.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lunar-blast></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Lunar Blast</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Full moons can help detox and charge the jewelry with the intention you want. Not only will the moon purify and cleanse jewelry, but you will also be given the chance to write your own intention with the jewelry under the lunar event. This allows you to manifest positive vibes for the future whenever you wear these pieces of jewelry.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-earthing></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Earthing</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have a favorite vintage piece with stones or crystals in it, earthing is a great idea for cleansing it. Place the jewelry in a little sachet or plastic bag, then bury it in the ground or a flower pot with soil in it. Bear in mind that you can also put the jewelry on grass or soil if you want — it's not necessary to bury it in the ground. Keep the jewelry there overnight or 24 hours&nbsp;maximum. Stones and crystals come from the bottom layers of the earth and rise to the surface over time. If they are put back into the earth, they will be able to energetically cleanse themselves and restore their natural vibrancy.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-crystal-cleanse></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Crystal Cleanse</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I opt for selenite, amethyst, or smoky quartz to cleanse items. That's because these are gentler on the items and do the trick just as fast as other crystals. Plus, they also lend healing and positive vibes to the person wearing the jewelry. If you're going to clean your jewelry with selenite, use it like a wand around the pieces. With amethyst and smoky quartz, leave the items on top, underneath, or to the sides of the crystal. The crystals will pull out any energy that should not be there and replace it with pure sentiments.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-floral-blends></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Floral Blends</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Personally, I am big on using fresh lavender and geranium flowers to cleanse jewelry or spaces. Their scents are very light and beautiful, and they can also help change your energy or vibe. You can use flowers to cleanse your vintage jewelry in a multitude of ways. One is by burning the flowers, thus cleansing the jewelry by "smoking out" the energy. You can also cut up the flowers and put them in a little dish with jewelry placed in it. Thirdly, you can roll the flowers around the pieces of jewelry that you want cleansed.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-brown-rice></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Brown Rice</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Putting jewelry in a bag or a bowl of brown rice is an amazing — and, perhaps, the simplest! — way to naturally cleanse your jewelry of negativity. That's because brown rice is a natural agent that can help detox items, particularly gemstones. To make your items feel brand new, place your jewelry in a bowl or pouch of brown rice for approximately 24 to 48 hours. Once you take it out, it'll be as good as new.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x6iuZqyfYrCtscCnqp5lpp67ta3GnmSjnaeaubPFjG5rcnFga4Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chelsea-skidmore.html><span>←</span><span>Chelsea Skidmore</span></a>
