"Everyone should walk more. I mean that's one of the great things about living in Brooklyn and in New York. You get to eat a big rich fatty meal but then you can walk home."</p><p>And for those of us in a non-walking city?</p><p>"[There's] this really nerdy workout I do in my walk-through closet in our brownstone," she explains. "I do a workout video and use my own music-whatever is inspiring to me at that time, like Alabama Shakes, the Cure, or Mumford and Sons."</p><p>The actress, who says she didn't start eating vegetables "until I was 30," now has a much healthier diet ... but, at 37, her body has made one change she's not happy with.</p><p>"The thing I notice most is my butt," says Keri. "I used to have a really good, plump butt. Ugh-now my butt's gone. I do wish I had my 25-year-old butt!"</p><p>Check out more photos from Keri Russel's Women's Health shoot above -- plus see what happened to the rest of the "Felicity" cast below:</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fb/o/2013/06/18/fb26377797175e67b01d3279f651f48b_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnR7j21mampfoLKztYyrrKyrlaG5bq3BrGSwp52au7R5x56YpayYYr2pu9Ooqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./benefits-of-black-currant-1227285.html><span>←</span><span>Health Benefits of Black Currant: Nutrition &amp;amp; How to Use</span></a>
