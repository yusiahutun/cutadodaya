It’s hard to miss the big ring on Bethenny’s finger in these new pictures, which you can see below, and that’s because the ring has one large emerald cut diamond surrounded by two smaller ones, and it’s worth an estimated $3 million, according to Daily Mail."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

She tells <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY, “[The ring] looks to have at least a 15-carat, emerald cut center with emerald side stones, set in platinum, the best metal to set diamonds in as it holds them most securely and enhances their brilliance. I would estimate the ring to cost at least $1 million, maybe $1.5 million. Emerald center stones set in platinum are a favorite of celebrities including <strong>Beyonce</strong>, <strong>Jennifer</strong> <strong>Lawrence</strong> and <strong>Anne</strong> <strong>Hathaway</strong>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bethenny-Frankel-Shows-Off-Engagement-Ring-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>If either estimation holds true, Bethenny’s new engagement ring would be much bigger than the $150,000 Kristen Farrell 6.5-carat pear-shaped ring that Jason gave her in October 2009.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>After Bethenny and Jason got married in 2010, they split in Dec. 2012, and she filed for divorce the very next month. Unfortunately for her, however, their divorce lasted over eight years, and it was just finalized by a judge this past January, according to New York Post‘s&nbsp;<a class=external-link title="(opens new window)" href=# rel="noopener nofollow" aria-describedby=external-disclaimer data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>. She and Paul started dating in 2018. She also shares a 10-year-old daughter, <strong>Bryn</strong>, with Jason.
