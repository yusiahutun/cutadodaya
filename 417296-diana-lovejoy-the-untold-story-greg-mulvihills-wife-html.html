They dated for one year before getting married in a private wedding ceremony in 2007. The duo lived together as husband and wife for seven years.</p><p class=align-left>However, their marriage was not a bed of roses as she suffered eight miscarriages before she finally gave birth to their son. Diana Lovejoy and Greg Mulvihill's relationship did not have a happily ever after ending as she filed for divorce in 2014.</p><p class=align-left>Diana Lovejoy's case took two years. At first, the court granted her full custody of their son, and Greg was only allowed to visit him for a few hours under supervision. She cited sexual abuse as the reason for the divorce, but the investigations disapproved the claims.</p><p class=align-left>Greg was required to pay $100 per month as child support. In summer 2016, the court ruled that Greg and his wife should share custody of their son and the monthly payments for child support. At that time, she was earning $10,000 per month. Diana kept their <a href=#>family</a> house in Carlsbad, but she was required to pay her ex-husband $120,000.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/21c01e2079564638.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bishop Allan Kiuna Discloses Using KSh 460m for Cancer Treatment Abroad: "Didn't Remove One Coin"</span></p></a><h3>The murder attempt</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cfaca6fcc27a42dd.jpg><p class=align-left>In a surprising twist of events, Diana conspired with her shooting instructor, McDavid, to kill her ex-husband because she did not want to share custody. She executed the crime four months after she paid Greg the $120,000 settlement.</p><p class=align-left>On 4 September 2016, Diana Lovejoy's husband <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">received a call </a>from someone who claimed that he was a private investigator. He told Greg that he could provide evidence showing that he was abusive, which could be used against him in the divorce case.</p><p class=align-left>The caller convinced him to go to a dirt path of Avenida Soledad, near Rancho Santa Fe, to collect the evidence. Greg went to the location in the company of his friend Jason Kovach. There was no such evidence.
