It was on the Art History course, which he enrolled in 2001, he met his future wife <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a>. However, he later decided he wanted to change his major and decided to switch to geography. The authors wrote both <a href=#>King Charles</a> and the late Prince Philip were supportive of his decision.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/12/GettyImages-1256259508-e1703871396470-1024x579.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-william-worried-about-being-a-failure-at-university>Prince William worried about being a ‘failure’ at university</h2><p>Howard and Tillett wrote about how Prince William struggled to “click” with the subject he had chosen, but was worried about the public’s perception of him if he changed his course. He fretted over being seen to have chosen an “uninspired degree.” However, according to the book, his family were supportive.</p><p>“William had been immersing himself in the world of Old Masters and classical art—he hadn’t clicked with the subject, and worse, he was terrified of public failure,” they penned. “He was preyed upon by the prospect of getting a reputation for weak work or an uninspired degree at the end of years of hassle and fuss for everyone.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>TV show depicts Prince Harry as whiny teenager ‘jealous’ of William</a></p><p>Charles was “thoughtful” when it came to his son’s mental state while away studying in Scotland. The authors say he would have taken extra care considering he and William’s grandad both went to boarding school.</p><p>The book adds: “Given William’s status and, yes, the huge amount of work that had gone into creating a safe space for him to work and live, Charles counseled caution.”</p><p>Talking about his choice to switch courses, William said he was “daunted” but Charles was “very understanding” and they connected over having similar educational experiences.</p><p>The prince said at the time: “I don’t think I was homesick, I was more daunted. My father was very understanding about it and realized I had the same problem as he probably had. We chatted a lot, and in the end, we both realized – I definitely realized – that I had to come back.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-heir-to-the-throne-s-normal-university-experience>The heir to the throne’s ‘normal’ university experience</h2><p>In an interview with The Guardian in 2003, the year he began dating Kate Middleton, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke</a> about his “near-normal” university experience. Though people recognized him, he said people “very kindly” let him be.</p><p>“People here just treat me like everyone else – it’s really nice,” William confessed.</p><p>“I’m able to lead a near-normal life. The media have been very good considering how tantalizing it is having me up here, and the people of St Andrews and the students have been so supportive. So, basically, I feel very comfortable.”</p><p>The royal continued: “When I’m walking around, you see people chatting and so on in their own little worlds – and I always go into my own little world as well – and you don’t really notice what’s going on around you. But the local residents, I’m sure, know what I do. They know the routes I take. Yet, very kindly, they just get on with their lives, their shopping and things like that.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Kate Middleton’s terrible gift from Prince William ‘didn’t go down well’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2eGcLzRoqWcnV2stq24yJqkZq%2Bfp7%2BqscNmmJunpal6o7HIp55mmV2brqq41KucZpmkYsKvtdWeqayhpK56osHToaarZZOhrqq50mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meaning-of-little-white-lies-by-one-direction.html><span>←</span><span>Meaning of Little White Lies by One Direction</span></a>
