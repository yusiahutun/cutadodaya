He's got some really cool motors, like his Aston Martin DBS that he totally loves.</p><p>But his top pick is his Porsche Cayenne 4. 2 V8 diesel perfect for road trips. Brundle's also had some fancy Ferraris, like the 328 GTS, 355 GTB, and a 550 Maranello.</p><p>His very first ride was a Toyota Corolla Coupe SR that he jazzed up with "Wolfrace wheels" when he was just starting out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><h3>Family and friends</h3><p>Brundle met his wife Liz while they were both students in King's Lynn, and the couple now have two children. Like his dad, their son Alex also made a name for himself in sports car racing and even took part in the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans race.</p><p>He also commentates for Sky Sports F1's coverage of F2 and F3 races. Brundle is mates with Channel 4 commentator David Coulthard, and the pair celebrated Martin's 50th birthday last year with a meal out.</p><p>Brundle is also part of a group of British drivers called the 'Rat Pack', which includes Damon Hill and the former Top Gear Stig, Perry McCarthy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32234913.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Untitled-1.jpg><h3>Hobbies</h3><p>Did you know that ex-F1 star Martin is a big music fan? Last summer he posted a clip of him at a Rolling Stones gig in London's Hyde Park.</p><p>He thought it was awesome, saying: "The Stones were pure class in Hyde Park. Forget the octogenarian backstory, they are great and energetic musicians and entertainers. Wonderful."</p><p>Like most racing drivers, Martin loves anything on wheels and has a soft spot for motorcycles. He told Evo magazine: "I'm also into bikes. I've got a BMW K1600 GT, straight-six across the frame. I ride to a handful of European F1 races each season."</p><p>He often promotes motorcycling and talks about why it makes him tick during TV and radio interviews.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><h3>Racing</h3><p>Martin Brundle had an epic fight with Ayrton Senna back in 1983 for the Formula Three title. Senna won, but he still said something mega nice about Martin.</p><p>On Instagram, Martin shared: "Ayrton told me at this moment, happy in F3 championship victory in the final few laps, that I was the best British driver since Jim Clark."</p><p>Martin then raced in F1 from 1984 and later took a break to race other cool cars. He won the big Le Mans race in 1990 and came back to F1, but never got to win a Grand Prix.</p><p>Now, Martin is famous for talking about F1 on telly and sometimes races with his son Alex in old fast cars like the Jaguar E-Type at Silverstone Classic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8VqZqaZoqm2r3nBq6ynnJyaeq%2Bx02auqKqknXquu82esGZrYmeBdn%2BPbQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emily-obrien-age-height-net-worth-affairs-boyfriend-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Emily OBrien Age, Height, Net Worth, Affairs, Boyfriend &amp;amp; Wiki</span></a>
