Founder and CEO Nicci Levy aims to change the conversation about cosmetic injectables and ease any fears people have around the pain or discomfort, looking “fake” and the price. “When I worked at Allergan, I realized just how real the stigma around injectables was and how uneducated people were on the topic,” Levy said in a statement. “I met people who wanted to try Botox but hadn’t because they were either scared of looking overdone, were intimidated by the cost, or had heard that it was painful or poisonous. Really what they were scared of was unknown; the industry was shrouded in mystery. I don’t think Botox should be such a mystery.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Copy-of-starring-Aly-Aj.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/these-skincare-products-are-the-next-best-thing-to-injectables.jpg><p>The only catch? You have to be able to get to an Alchemy 43 location, which are in <a href=#>Los Angeles</a> and <a href=#>New York City</a>. Then, you can just sign up <a href=#>for Botox</a> on one area of the face (up to 20 units) using <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">this link</a> or by texting 323-676-1438. A licensed medical professional (either a registered nurse, nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant) administers <a href=#>the Botox</a> in one of Alchemy 43’s sleek treatment rooms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/treatment-room.jpg><p>A medical director oversees each market and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Levy told The Cut</a>, “They’re [a resource] in case of an emergency and for clinical oversight of our injectors.” I’ve personally never had Botox but I did see Alchemy 43 for Juvederm injections in my smile lines and I felt safe and comfortable—and surprisingly not terrified. That being said, it’s up to you if you want to go to the Botox bar-like route or see a board-certified plastic surgeon instead.</p><p>If you do want to try Botox at <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Alchemy 43</a>, hurry—it’s sure to book up fast. The free days are on October 15 and October 16 and you’ll be able to learn all about the company’s membership service for future treatments.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWR%2BcYGSb2pqZ5GhsKmxzLJkbWtdm7%2BmsYybpq2nqGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./11-flesh-fly-facts.html><span>←</span><span>11 Flesh Fly Facts - Facts.net</span></a>
