A gay white father of a bi-racial child has been denied a spot on the&nbsp;San Francisco Board of Education's volunteer parent committee because his race doesn't bring enough diversity to the group.&nbsp;
The issue of whether to allow Seth Brenzel to volunteer for the 15-person parent advisory council was debated for almost two hours on Tuesday night during a board meeting."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

James Lick - who resided in San Francisco - was also deemed 'racist' after members failed to critically read an article about the famous 19th century businessman.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The committee stated that Lick had funded a sculpture showing an American Indian lying at the feet of white men.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, in actuality, Lick died 18 years before the sculpture was created, and it was only partially funded by his posthumous estate.&nbsp;</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lopez also pushed back on the complaints that historians were not consulted as part of the process.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Among the names included on the list that had provoked pushback from residents and historians was President Abraham Lincoln.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lopez said that she did not believe Lincoln was a person she would 'admire or see as a hero'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I think that the killing of indigenous peoples and that record is something that is not acknowledged,' she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's something that people are now learning about, and due to this process. And so, we just have to do the work of that extra learning when we're having these discussions.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lopez also claimed that the renaming was only facing criticism because 'people will always have a problem with the discussion of racism', not because of the inaccurate information.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'That is what I know.
