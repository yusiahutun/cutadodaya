Seeing how far Raq is willing to take, her lust for power has disgusted Lou Lou; these days, it appears that he’s looking for a way out.</p><p id=par-4_43>The only issue is, Raq will never let her baby brother go so easily. Things have been tense between Lou and Raq since she tasked him with killing Kanan’s friend D-Wiz (Nile Bullock).
