After weeks of vague statements from the palace, we may finally have a better idea of when we’ll be seeing more of the princess.</p><p>Chances are, if you’ve been on the internet in recent weeks, you’ve seen that Princess Kate has found herself at the center of a crazy media storm. It all started when she stepped away from public facing duties to <a href=#>get surgery</a> in mid-January 2024. But conversations about the future queen got especially intense on social media following the release of a <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1737606>digitally altered portrait</a> intended to commemorate British Mother’s Day.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/prince-william-kate-middleton-conspiracy-theories.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/king-charles-medical-records.jpg><p>The photo, which was shared on the Prince and Princess of Wales’ official Kensington Palace social media accounts, ignited controversy as glaring editing errors came to light and prompted major news outlets to retract its distribution. The palace issued a personal apology, attributed to Kate, for the photo’s manipulation. But the damage was already done, as royal followers continued to raise questions about the altered photo and the ongoing secrecy surrounding Kate’s health.</p><p>The Princess of Wales was hospitalized for what Kensington Palace described as a “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1724595>planned abdominal surgery</a>” on January 17, 2024. At the time, the palace announced that Kate would not be participating in royal duties until after Easter. This hasn’t stopped the public from coming up with a host of <a href=#>conspiracy theories</a> surrounding Kate’s absence. In an attempt to quell the conspiracies, the palace reiterated their stance in another statement a few weeks later, sharing, “It was made very clear from the outset that the Princess of Wales would be out until after Easter, and updates from Kensington Palace would only be provided when something significant occurred.”</p><p>Clearly, the palace hasn’t been keen on sharing too many details about <a href=# id=auto-tag_kate-middleton data-tag=kate-middleton>Kate Middleton</a>‘s return—however, we may finally have some updates from some sources reportedly “close” to Princess Kate and Prince William. Here’s what they’ve said about Kate Middleton’s return to royal duties so far.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=when-will-kate-middleton-return-to-royal-duties>When will Kate Middleton return to royal duties?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kate-middleton.png><p>A new report by the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sunday Times</a> may have given us a major clue about Kate Middleton’s return. according to sources who spoke to the publication, the Princess of Wales return may not take place until April 17, 2024. Insiders are citing this date in particular because it happens to coincide with the end of her children’s school break.</p><p>Sources reportedly close to the Prince and Princess of Wales told the outlet that Kate may even decide to publicly address her health once she’s back in the spotlight. “They are at their most open when out interacting with members of the public and I can see a world in which the princess might discuss her recovery out on engagements,” one insider said of the couple. “If she was going to do it, that’s how she would do it.”</p><p>“They will want to be clear and more open, but they’ll do it when they feel ready,” a friend added. “I would expect that to be her instinct and it will be her call. They’re not going to be rushed.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endgame-Novel.jpg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$19.41</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$32.00</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>39% Off</span></p><p>Endgame, the explosive book from longtime royal journalist Omid Scobie and author of the international blockbuster&nbsp;Finding Freedom,&nbsp;is a penetrating investigation into the current state of the British monarchy—”an unpopular king, a power-hungry heir to the throne, a queen willing to go to dangerous lengths to preserve her image, and a prince forced to start a new life after&nbsp;being betrayed by his own family.”</p><p>Queen Elizabeth II’s death ruptured the already-fractured foundations of the House of Windsor—and dismantled the protective shield around it. With an institution long plagued by antiquated ideas around race, class and money, the monarchy and those who prop it up are now exposed and at odds with a rapidly modernizing world. Relying on his vast experience as a royal reporter and over a decade of conversations and interviews with current and former Palace staff, trusted friends of the royals and even the family members themselves, Scobie pulls back the curtain on an institution in turmoil to show what the monarchy must change in order to survive.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
