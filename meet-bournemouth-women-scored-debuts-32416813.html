"The girls seem great, there are really good facilities and Steve [Cuss] seems a great manager, so I’m really excited to get going. They have got a great ambition here and good goals to achieve. I want to help achieve that and be a part of that to take into next season."</p><p>Bowers will be joined by Butler - who had been on loan at Oxford United for the first half of the season. Butler is no stranger to the upper echelons of the game, and she briefly dated Lionesses' hero Lauren Hemp.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32345942.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_hockeyplayersplit.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><p>The pair were both on the scoresheet as they made their Cherries bow in the week travelling to Maidenhead. Butler netted the pick of the goals, intercepting the ball deep in Maidenhead territory before beating the keeper at the near post.</p><p>On Sunday, the pair are expected to be in action again for their clash with Keynsham Town at the Vitality Stadium. Ahead of the game, Bournemouth announced 5,000 tickets have already been sold for the third-tier women's clash.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Wopq2akaG5cLnEnqtmmp%2Bqv6%2BxzKisraBdrLyusc1mqpynopqxbrDEm6ytq11of3V9lXFobA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-antiques-road-trip-experts-bbc.html><span>←</span><span>Meet the Antiques Road Trip experts: from Izzie Balmer to Natasha Raskin Sharp</span></a>
