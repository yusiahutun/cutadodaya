Your <a href=#>April horoscopes for 2023</a> begins with <a href=# id=auto-tag_aries-season data-tag=aries-season>Aries season</a> still in full swing, fueling our fiery, impulsive side. We don’t want to ask for permission when Aries is in-charge. Just be careful not to let a hot-temper and combative nature slip through as well. Keep the Mars energy of Aries working in your favor!</p><p>On April 3, <a href=#>Mercury moves into Taurus</a>, focusing our minds on practical affairs. During this transit, it’s easier to solidify plans and take tangible steps forward. The flexibility of Mercury doesn’t always love the rigidity of <a href=# id=auto-tag_taurus data-tag=taurus>Taurus</a> so we should all watch out for a tendency to dig in our heels. Stay open-minded and don’t say no to something just because it is new and different. Mercury will <a href=#>station retrograde on April 21</a>, bringing about delays and miscommunications around our finances and other practical affairs. This is a good time to rework your finances and try to get things organized so that when Mercury goes direct on May 14, you can make whatever changes you have been planning. Definitely wait to open any new credit cards or purchase anything big until after this time, if you can.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question3.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/newmoonintauruszodiac.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1"><p>The <a href=#>Full Moon in Libra</a> on April 6 is a great time to think about our balance between meeting our personal needs and tending to the needs of others.
