The change was a huge shock—especially because it’s been a while since we’ve seen <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Rihanna blonde</a>. And although we might’ve thought the curly updo was her chicest hairstyle, she’s already proved us wrong. While we were still collecting ourselves from her blonde reveal, Rihanna just updated her blonde with a new hairstyle that’s the best of both worlds.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/rihanna_180530.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/spraying-hair-adobe_954909.png><p>Rihanna is no stranger to changing her hair color. Last month alone, she donned two different hair colors—caramel-brown highlights for <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>her Vogue China cover</a> and ginger in her newest <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Savage X campaign</a>. Both were stunning and gave us a preview of light hair that we’re not used to seeing on Rihanna. And while those looks were exciting, this new icy blonde is unlike anything we’ve seen from her. While fans loved her 2012 rooty blonde, something about this blonde in particular symbolizes a brand new era for Rihanna.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2149079693.jpg><p>Leave it to Rihanna to reinvent an already brand-new hair color. On April 17, the star arrived to the FENTY x PUMA&nbsp;launch party with luscious long blonde hair and heavy Hannah Montana-esque bangs. We weren’t shocked after seeing Rihanna pull off blonde so well, so naturally these bangs are just the cherry on top.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Bangs have been a huge trend</a> recently and while most stars favor wispy curtain bangs, Rihanna is making the case for classic blunt bangs. Paired with face-framing layers and warm highlights, all she’s missing for a full Hannah Montana look is a sequin top and white skinny jeans. With this rocking hairstyle, Rihanna is truly channeling her double life fantasy and we’re taking note of how versatile her blonde can be.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-2139222899.jpg><p>Rihanna first debuted her icy blonde hair with the hottest hairstyle of the year—<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>the Y2K prom updo</a>. The curly updo has been seen on all the it girls, and it has us seriously nostalgic for all of the prom hairstyles of decades’ past. While <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Ariana Grande dressed up the hairstyle</a> at the Oscars, Rihanna paired the updo with jeans and looked equally chic.</p><p>While we’re huge fans of the blonde, no one knows how long Rihanna will stick with this hair before experimenting with a new color. At the very least, we have these photos to remember how stunning she looks blonde.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2BmrdStsGasopq7pb%2BOam5tcWFognC%2ByKGYp6aRYq%2Btu82dnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./488375-grandma-steals-show-sleek-dance-moves-ohangla-tune-wedding-dani-ako-fine.html><span>←</span><span>Grandma Steals Show with Sleek Dance Moves to Ohangla Tune During Wedding: &amp;quot;Dani ako Fine&amp;quot;</span></a>
