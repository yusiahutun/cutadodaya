All precious metals are prone to scratches and dirt build up, but it's important to make sure that you’re cleaning each metal in the right way to avoid any permanent damage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With gold, you will need to be careful with the different karat weights, and the gems set within it, before polishing, while earrings are extremely fiddly so can cause problems of their own. With sterling silver, you need a multi-faceted approach.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below, we round up top tips from jewellery experts on how to clean your favourite silver jewellery, and keep it sparkling and scratch-free.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Avoid harsh chemicals and cosmetics</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Silver requires a little more care and maintenance than gold. It is prone to tarnishing so regular cleaning and polishing is needed to keep it close to its original condition,” says Jack Cannon, co-founder of London-based jewellery brand Hatton Labs. “The best way to keep your silver looking its best is to avoid exposure to chemicals; remove your jewellery before using detergents or cleaning products and be cautious with lotions, perfumes and hairspray as these are the slow killers of silver,” he explains. It’s a good idea to take your silver off before exercising too, as sweat can accelerate the tarnishing process.</p><img alt="julianne moore" title='"On The Fringe" (En Los Margenes) Red Carpet - 79th Venice International Film Festival' width=683 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/julianne-moore-attends-the-on-the-fringe-red-carpet-at-the-news-photo-1690374567.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Dominique Charriau</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Prevent tarnishing with silver polish</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It feels counterintuitive, but wearing your pieces regularly can actually help prevent tarnish build up,” explains Anna Jewsbury, founder of London-based brand Completed Works, who regularly works in silver set with crystals. “If tarnishing does occur, specialist polishing cloths are great for sterling silver but can remove the plating of silver-plated pieces over time, so a better option is a plain microfibre cloth.” There are natural irritants to silver too, such as salt air and salt water, which can both reduce its bright white shine. “After exposure to salty water, natural lustre and original brightness can be restored in just a few minutes with an off-the-shelf silver polishing product available in most hardware stores,” advises Louie Cresswell, founder of Ouie, who crafts sleek sterling silver toggle and keyring-inspired pieces.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Consider storage carefully</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Because silver scores lower than gold alloys on the MOH scale (the scale that determines hardness and durability) it is more prone to scratching. “Most small scratches can be polished out with a polishing cloth, but deeper scratches will need to be buffed out by a professional,” explains Cresswell. The best approach is prevention rather than cure, and this is where proper storage makes all the difference. “The best way to store silver is an airtight container, ideally with dividers to separate each piece so that scratches don’t occur,” says Jewsbury. “Try to avoid extreme temperatures and humidity if you can – if you live in a humid climate, I recommend placing a small packet of desiccant crystals in your jewellery box.”</p><img alt="street style" title="Street Style - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear Fall Winter 2023 2024 : Day Seven" width=1024 height=683 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fashion-week-guest-seen-wearing-a-beige-turtle-neck-a-dark-news-photo-1690374810.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jeremy Moeller</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Take your lead from the professionals</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Some brands, such as London-based label Otiumberg, provide specialist pouches to store your pieces in, which takes some of the worry away. You can also buy an ultrasonic cleaner for home use – the machine many jewellers use for professional cleaning, which uses high frequency pressure waves to dislodge dirt. It is, however, important to not clean pieces set with porous pearls, emeralds, or opals this way, as it can damage the gems. The golden rule? “When in doubt,” says Canon, “it's best to consult with a professional.”</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Highlights from the A/W 2023 Couture Shows" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/2023-hbz-aw23couture-thumb-1-64ae6d09d49db.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmS3psPEpaOeqqlixKLAwqGcrGeRaYF3gJdwcG1nmKTEbsDOZpqlnZGjerTAxKujoqaXYsCquNWeqWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./343-christmas-lights.html><span>←</span><span>#343 Christmas Lights.
