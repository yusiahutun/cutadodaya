A young, relatively unknown lad from Southern California took everyone by surprise by winning the show and bagging a $135,000 cash prize.</p><p>The ambitious, once-obscure racer became famous almost overnight, and everyone wanted to know who Brandon James was. Aside from racing, his new fans were also eager to find out about the personal life of this new kid on the block.</p><p>A major question people are asking is who is Brandon James dating? Is he married? If he is seeing someone, who is his girlfriend?</p><p>Well, we did some digging and are happy to give you the insider scoop on just who is Brandon James Street Outlaws girlfriend.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brandon James on Street Outlaws</h2><p>Brandon James is the newest and youngest superstar of the <a href=#>popular reality show Street Outlaws</a>. However, the 28-year-old youthful racer has never participated in the Discovery Channel program. He only came to compete in the spin-off’s Mega Cash Days, where he literally made waves for a racer who was previously unknown.</p><p>James has always been a drag racer, though. He began street racing at a young age, even going to train at the Frank Hawley Drag Racing School, where he gained tremendous technical and practical racing skills. The fact that his father was actively involved in his racing career motivated the young Brandon to perfect his art and aim for the sky.&nbsp;</p><p>His first drag racing car was a 1956 Chevrolet Bel Air which he drove in Orange County and the greater west coast for a while. He later acquired a 1958 Mustang, which he rode to victory in the Mega Cash Days&nbsp;race defeating the who’s of who of the street racing scene.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 2021 show, he competed against fellow participants Kye Kelley, James Finney, <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1131>Justin Shearer</a>, Ryan Martin, Mike Murillo, <a href=# data-type=post data-id=5192>Shawn Ellington</a>, and other popular drag racers.&nbsp;</p><p>Mega Cash Days&nbsp;is a double elimination race where a racer can advance despite losing in the previous race. But, not one to stick to the script, the American racer was undefeated through six rounds of racing, finally defeating Dennis Bailey and taking home $135,000 out of a possible prize of $600,000.</p><p>In the finale, he earned the title of the 2021 Street Outlaws: Mega Cash Days series winner.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Brandon James Have a Girlfriend?</h2><p>Aside from his prowess on the racing track, there is no denying that the 28-year-old Brandon James is a looker. He is young, aggressive, charismatic, handsome, and recently became rich– he is the total package and a dream come true for anyone looking for a suitor.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, his fans have wanted to know what is Brandon James relationship status. Ladies and gentlemen alike are even curious about Brandon James Street Outlaws girlfriend name.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, or unfortunately, it doesn’t look like the drag racer is hooked to anyone at the moment. Going by his social media profiles, there is no sighting of any special lady with whom he is in a committed relationship. On both Instagram and Meta, it is just pictures of himself with his vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The youthful racer has obviously chosen to keep his relationship status private by not posting pictures of his significant other. Or, it could be that he is single and genuinely has no lovey-dovey pictures to post.&nbsp;</p><p>It is hard to believe that such an attractive, excellent racer and newly-minted celebrity is not in a committed relationship. But for now, we can only assume that Brandon James does not have a girlfriend, and neither is he married. He has probably chosen to focus on his racing career.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no doubt that James is easily one of the greatest drag racers in the Discovery show’s history, and we wish him the best.&nbsp;</p><p>For more Brandon James action, check out season 3 of the&nbsp;Street Outlaws: Fastest in America&nbsp;on Discovery, which premiered on January 11, 2022.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmsKCfYra0ecGrmKecn6N6q63MnqpmnqKkum6%2F06ucnqxdpMK1uMCwqmafmae5p77InqWdZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vintage-christmas-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Photos of Vintage Style Icons During Christmas</span></a>
