A dress code is a set of guidelines for what students should wear, unlike school uniforms which restrict students to a handful of outfits, whether or not they fit the day’s weather or activities. Dress codes enable students to choose clothes that help them feel comfort without overstepping what the school deems as appropriate attire.</span></p><p type=p><span type=text>Without a strict school uniform, students can wear clothes that reduce the sweaty, smelly aftermath of PE lessons. Although PE uniforms are meant for physical activity, in reality they are stiff and not very breathable. It is so uncomfortable to run in scorching hot weather, wearing a thick shirt sticky with sweat. But if students choose what they wear, they can replace the uniform with sportswear that is more suitable to their body’s movements and needs.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><a href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><span type=text>Are textbooks outdated in Hong Kong?</span></a></strong></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>In the summer, boys normally have to bear the heat in trousers, while in classrooms that are freezing from the air conditioning, girls only have a blazer or cardigan to wear on top of their paper-thin uniforms. As a result, students of all genders are often fidgeting in their uniforms. However, with a dress code, students can choose outfits that will help them adjust to abrupt changes in temperature.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Economically speaking, uniforms can be expensive. But dress codes allow students to wear what they already have in their wardrobes, and they can buy less expensive clothing items according to their family budget.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">Students would feel more comfortable wearing their own clothes, and they may be less expensive than uniforms.</span></span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Uniforms also represent a student’s school, along with whatever reputation it may have, so uniforms might label students with any negative stereotypes associated with their schools. Dress codes, however, can prevent students from constantly being tied to their school’s reputation, and possibly being bullied for it.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Since dress codes can clearly define the appropriate clothing that students should wear at school, they should replace uniforms.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><a href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><span type=text>Does learning from home do more harm than good?</span></a></strong></p><p><h3 type=h3><span type=text>Hannah Wu, 15, Island School</span></h3></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>We’ve all experienced standing in front of our wardrobes, struggling to find the right thing to wear for every occasion. As a student, I’m grateful for the convenience that my uniform bring me. Every weekday morning, all I have to do is throw it on after washing up and eating breakfast, and then I sprint out the door. Wearing a uniform saves me so much time, especially when I oversleep or spend too much time eating breakfast.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Dress codes don’t give students the same benefits that school uniforms give. For example, when everyone dresses differently, students will feel little to no school pride on their way in to class. What’s more, strict dress codes can cause headaches for students who need to buy specific clothes to fit the guidelines, while lax ones leave it to individual teachers to decide what they think is appropriate for students to wear, leaving much uncertainty.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">School uniforms take away the stress of deciding what to wear every day.</span></span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>There are numerous benefits to wearing school uniforms.
