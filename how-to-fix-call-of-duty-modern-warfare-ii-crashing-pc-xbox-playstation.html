If you've been plagued by a few too many crashes in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, here are some troubleshooting tips that should get you back on your winning streak in no time.</p><h2 id=ensure-you-have-a-strong-and-stable-internet-connection>Ensure You Have a Strong and Stable Internet Connection</h2><p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II was initially anticipated to be playable online and offline, but this is not the case. A solid and stable internet connection is required even during the campaign. This still applies even when you're playing in Steam offline mode.</p><p>Ensuring your internet connection is actually capable of running the game smoothly is something you should definitely be doing before you purchase the game. If your internet connection isn't strong enough to support it, it means that the problem doesn't lie within the game itself and troubleshooting is unlikely to help.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=basic-troubleshooting-tips>Basic Troubleshooting Tips</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/gamer-troubleshooting-pc-before-heading-into-match.jpg><p>While the best fix for the crashes in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II would be an update by Infinity Ward, many gamers need a more immediate solution rather than waiting for an update or patch. Still, if you want to see which issues the developers are handling, you can check out the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Infinity Ward Trello Board</a> for updates.</p><p>Infinity Ward is constantly releasing updates and support for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II. But for now, there are several things you can do yourself to help your situation if you find you're experiencing poor performance.</p><h3 id=console-exclusive-solutions-for-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii>Console-Exclusive Solutions for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</h3><p>If you are experiencing an excess of crashes that make your COD experience incredibly frustrating, the first thing you should do is, in the wise words of many a tech guru, turn your console off and on again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hearing this might frustrate you even more, but it truly does wonders in many situations if you just give it a go. And when it comes to troubleshooting, testing the most simple remedies before moving on to the complicated ones is always a good tactic.</p><p>If you're playing COD on an Xbox or PlayStation console, the following troubleshooting method is suitable for both:</p><li>Restart the console. For the PS5, this can be done through the home menu or via safe mode. Follow our guide if you want to know more about <a href=#>safe mode on the PS5 and how to use it</a>.</li><li>Update the game and the console to the latest version.</li><li>Ensure your console is in a well-ventilated area and is not at risk of overheating.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If your console isn't running on the latest version or is struggling to regulate its temperature, this could result in game crashes.</p><h3 id=pc-exclusive-solutions-for-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii>PC-Exclusive Solutions for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare-II-campaign-homepage-screenshot.jpg><p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is a beefy game that requires powerful hardware to run properly. The first thing you should do before attempting any other troubleshooting methods on your PC is to ensure that your specs are capable of running the game.</p><p>The minimum requirements to run the game suggested by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Activision</a> are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64 Bit (latest update)</li><li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i3-6100 / Core i5-2500K or AMD Ryzen 3 1200</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 8 GB</li><li><strong>Hi-Rez Assets Cache:</strong> Up to 32 GB</li><li><strong>Video Card:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 or AMD Radeon RX 470</li><li><strong>Video Memory:</strong> 2 GB</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If your PC doesn't meet the above minimum requirements to run COD: MWII, then, unfortunately, none of the other troubleshooting methods are going to be enough to get the game running smoothly.</p><p>However, if your PC can run the game, but it's still crashing frequently, you can try several more troubleshooting methods to get the game working for you.</p><li>Make sure you have the latest graphics driver installed. You can check out our <a href=#>guide on updating your graphics drivers in Windows 10</a> if you're unsure how to do it.</li><li>Shut down all unnecessary programs.</li><li>Disable any overlaying applications that might be interfering with the game, such as Discord or Steam.</li><li>If you've already done the above, but are still experiencing issues, try reverting your graphics driver to the previous version. Here's how you can <a href=#>roll back a driver in Windows 10</a>.</li><li>Monitor the temperature of your PC to ensure it isn't overheating.</li><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These general troubleshooting methods are often enough to solve your tech issues in many games, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is no different.</p><h2 id=troubleshooting-tips-unique-to-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii>Troubleshooting Tips Unique to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Screenshot-COD-MWII-cutscene-youtube.jpg><p>If you've already completed the above steps and still have some issues, you should try disabling these features in COD: MWII. While these features help improve your gaming experience if your equipment is capable of running them, they require a lot of power and can take resources away from the most essential aspects of the game.</p><p>These fixes aren't ideal and require you to change some settings or even how you play the game, but it could be enough to tide you over until a more reliable update is released.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=turn-off-parallax-effects>1. Turn Off Parallax Effects</h3><p>Parallax effects are advanced graphical techniques that build the game's depth of field and realism. Parallax effects make faraway objects approach at a slower rate than the ones closest to you.</p><p>For example, when you are looking out a car window, you can see the road and fences whizzing past you while the mountains in the distance move at a much slower pace.</p><p>These effects may look cool, but they can be a lot for your processor to handle. And by turning them off, many have found relief from unexpected crashes. This solution is worth trying when you have exhausted all your other troubleshooting options.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Turn-off-parallax-effects-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To turn off your parallax effects, head to your in-game <strong>Settings</strong>, scroll down to <strong>Interface</strong>, and turn off <strong>Parallax Effects</strong>.</p><h3 id=use-an-untuned-gun>2. Use an Untuned Gun</h3><p>Another fix that has been curing gamers' crashing woes is playing with an untuned gun. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II offers a tremendous amount of customization regarding weapons and their settings, and one of these customization techniques is weapon tuning.</p><p>Once unlocked, you can add attachments to your gun, which you can tweak to suit your preferences. However, many players have reported experiencing crashes at a higher rate during loadout with weapons equipped with attachment tuning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is obviously not an ideal fix, as the customization options help gamers find their perfect weapon and hone it to their particular skills. Sacrificing your weapon tuning to make the game work better for you is a very short-term fix, but it could be enough to get you through until a more reliable patch is released.</p><h2 id=give-modern-warfare-ii-some-time>Give Modern Warfare II Some Time</h2><p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is a great game, but it does require a lot of juice to get it running smoothly. Many factors could cause your game to crash out or glitch and many of them are out of your control, such as packed servers or weather troubles affecting your internet connection.</p><p>But making sure you are always running the software on the latest version and ensuring your console itself is up-to-date can do wonders. And, if not, hopefully, some of the other hacks we've listed help improve your gaming experience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifqK9dqbxussixZJyZnKF6sLKMnaytsV2ivKWx0adksJmim66zsYyioGabopbAqbXNoGSpm12tr7DEjKmjmrGjqa61tc6nZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michelle-pfeiffers-husband-david-e-kelley-red-carpet-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Michelle Pfeiffers Husband David E.
