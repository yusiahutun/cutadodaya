Her grandmother Hélène Fould-Springer, meanwhile, was French Jewish.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/38/16by9/2024/04/05/38446e8bd95f4e8bbbc1e0250c67ac67_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>One Life<strong> </strong>is a 2023 biographical drama film directed by James Hawes.</p><p>It tells the story of Nicholas Winton, a stockbroker -- played by Anthony Hopkins as an old man, Johnny Flynn in his youth -- who saved hundreds of mostly Jewish children from the hands of Hitler and the Nazis in Czechoslovakia during the early start of World War II. Bonham Carter plays Winton's mom, Babi, who assists in her son's journey.</p><p>While some actors may feel scared to tell a story so close to home, Bonham Carter said it didn't deter her.</p><p>"I find it's almost like I have to do it, I felt it was almost my story to tell in some ways, I owe my life to it, to what my ancestors did and they did very similar things," she explained.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a6/16by9/2024/04/05/a6209f1840894c3db4880235e1248781_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>She also found herself having deep sympathy for Babi, who, as a mother, had to deal with the juxtaposition of her son wanting to save lives, while putting his own in jeopardy.</p><p>"What she gave him as mom too -- at the beginning she's feeling a bit torn that she made a person who's got such great values and such heart," Bonham Carter said. "Also risking his own life so it's a very difficult position as a mother."</p><p>The actress, however, believes Babi felt the most "fulfilled" because she was doing a job that made her feel "worthwhile".</p><p>"'What are you going to do with your one wonderful life?', Bonham Carter said referencing the quote to poet Mary Oliver. "One life has such different meanings, his [Winton's] one life, boy did he save so many. There's this Jewish thing of saying, 'If you save one life, you save the world,' which is so true, he had no idea how may people he had impacted."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bb/16by9/2024/04/05/bb47fde1cbda4e5aaa0a8abb068ef1d6_md.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Playing someone like Babi was a bit aspirational for Bonham Carter, who believes she's "too apologetic" to do the things Babi did in her lifetime.</p><p>"When you play someone you think, 'Oh maybe a bit of their greatness is going to rub off on me,'" she shared. "I personally wouldn't have the chutzpah or fluency or the eloquence to do what she did."</p><p>Of the film's message, she added, "I think on the whole, what's so great about the movie and what people have really enjoyed, is they're like, 'Oh my God, we're living in such crap times,' and this film has given some sense of potency and agency and giving it back to the individual going like, 'We can do something guys, [Winton] is an every day stock broker who just thought, 'Right no, I'll just work it out and do it.'"</p><p>One Life -- which also stars Lena Olin, Jonathan Pryce and Romola Garai -- is in theaters now.</p><a id=gallery-link-17b47595-d4ef-4bbd-9540-12b93f128e7b class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:17b47595-d4ef-4bbd-9540-12b93f128e7b data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:785a2e56-89a5-4de9-9688-c5c315dc7fb6 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f1/4by3/2024/04/01/f1bdd6fc3db74d26a03476fd3763e052_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21maW1fnbKtsc2aZJunnp2urnnCmqmtnaJiwKLF0mamp51dobansYywmKxlkWLAtbvRsmSsoJVitaKwjK2mZqyVoblw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./travis-kelce-avoids-embarrassment-after-forgetting-underwear-on-andrew-santinos-podcast.html><span>←</span><span>Travis Kelce avoids embarrassment after forgetting underwear on Andrew Santino's podcast</span></a>
