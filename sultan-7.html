The movie stars Salman Khan, who plays the character of Sultan Ali Khan, a wrestler from Haryana. Sultan has lost everything important to him in life and has fallen into a deep state of sadness and hopelessness. The movie begins with Sultan, a former state-level wrestler, working as a cable TV operator and leading a mundane life. He is in love with Aarfa, played by Anushka Sharma, a wrestler and the daughter of a local wrestling coach. Despite his initial struggles, Sultan wins Aarfa's heart by defeating her in a wrestling match. The couple gets married, and Sultan decides to pursue wrestling, hoping to make Aarfa and his country proud. Aarfa and Sultan get selected for the Olympic team, and Aarfa realizes she's pregnant. She chooses to give up her dreams of winning a gold medal for India to take care of their child. However, Sultan becomes arrogant after winning the gold medal and even slaps a reporter. He leaves Aarfa alone near her delivery date to compete in a tournament in Turkey. Unfortunately, upon his return, he finds out that their newborn son had died due to severe anemia. The baby had a rare blood type, O-, identical to Sultan's, and he blames himself for not being able to donate blood to save the child. Aarfa is heartbroken and decides to leave Sultan to live with her father. Sultan, devastated by the loss of his wife and child, decides to start a blood bank in his son's name to help others in need. Sultan backs out of wrestling, and pursues a government job, as he felt that his pride in being a wrestler took everything away from him. The remaining parts of the story are in the movie.</p>Read more<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGikqK6Zmny0wcutmKdlZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pubic-hair-trends-full-bush-17208075.html><span>←</span><span>Put down the razors, ladies!
