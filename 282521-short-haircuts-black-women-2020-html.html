Let me not even get started on our dark melanin skin that screams beauty, or our wonderful body curves. No, let me leave all that behind(maybe sometime I shall get to write about these). Let me just concentrate on our hair - our thick, lustrous hair. As blessed as some of us are with a good head of hair, the question of how to style hair, more prominently, how to style short natural hair, is always a worry for many. While some people may opt for short natural hairstyles, there still are some very alluring short hairstyles for both textured and relaxed hair. Let us now take a look at some short hairstyles for black women, shall we?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/619927f80b919c6f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20+ best low-cut hairstyles for ladies with natural hair</span></p></a><h2><strong>1.
