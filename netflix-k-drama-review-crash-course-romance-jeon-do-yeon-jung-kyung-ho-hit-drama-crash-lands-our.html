Crash Course in Romance: Jeon Do-yeon, Jung Kyung-ho in Netflix romcom
Some, like Chi-yeol’s loyal assistant Ji Dong-hee (Shin Jae-ha), who was finally revealed as the story’s hoodie-wearing and catapult-wielding serial killer, are of the variety that populate our nightmares (or our late-night entertainment) but which few of us will encounter in our lives."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Driven by her mother, Jo Su-hui (Kim Sun-young), queen among the tiger mums, Su-a was the top student in their class. She was flummoxed when Hae-yi, the daughter of a humble neighbourhood business owner, began going toe to toe with her scholastically.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/07/28230b39-bd73-4e47-9246-a60471c90551_ffa35782.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Su-a is cruel to Hae-yi and conspires to keep her down, but she’s also driven by stress and expectations that become so overwhelming, they eventually transform her into a sympathetic character.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the most quietly heartbreaking moments in the series comes after she collapses upon learning that she came second to Hae-yi during the all-important mock exams.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After she is discharged from hospital, Su-hui offers her the rest of the day off, only to immediately retract the offer and push her to work even harder to make up for lost time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The added strain pushes Su-a over the edge and she begins having hallucinations as maths equations rise from the page and swim before her eyes. Her rage towards Hae-yi increases, and she begins having waking dreams of killing her, although thankfully she never goes beyond the point of no return.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/07/31b085c1-0fcc-4251-810e-d0b31bca5110_506b10b4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Perhaps the greatest villain in the show is society at large, the cause of all the pressures that drive the characters to do bad things.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After the misunderstanding that started their relationship, a misunderstanding that prompted Chi-yeol to break the phone of Haeng-seon’s brother Nam Jae-woo (Oh Eui-sik), Haeng-seon and Chi-yeol eventually formed an uneasy alliance – she provides him with daily lunchboxes, since he can’t keep down other food, and he gives Hae-yi secret classes after she is unfairly expelled from his exclusive “all care programme”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Their arrangement can’t stay secret forever, and once it does come out, it leads to several misunderstandings. Public scrutiny being what it is, the arrangement has to end, but the problem is that Chi-yeol has already developed feelings for Haeng-seon, try as he might to suppress them.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">7 of the best new Korean drama series to look out for in March 2023</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Haeng-seon is dragged over the coals for providing sexual favours to Chi-yeol to let her daughter get ahead, even though nothing of the sort happened. This falsehood is maintained so that Chi-yeol can avoid taking the blame and damaging his public image.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Then Haeng-seon accidentally attends an education talk without checking who the speaker is. Chi-yeol takes questions from the audience and is grilled over the scandal, but once Haeng-seon is criticised he loses it, owns up and comes to her defence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I had a crush on her,” he confesses as he stares at her across the room in the show’s most heart-swelling moment. He saves her but destroys himself, as this makes him the man trying to go after a married woman.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Of course, Haeng-seon isn’t actually married – that’s Hae-yi’s real mother, Haeng-ja.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/07/5440d351-10d6-423a-83d9-770528125829_5b8a5a5a.jpg>Bright and vivacious, Haeng-seon is a formidable K-drama lead and she’s played marvellously by Jeon Do-yeon, whose affecting performances have earned her many accolades over the years, including the best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival for <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Secret Sunshine</span></a>.<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Hospital Playlist</span></a> star Jung Kyung-ho is also on form as the debonair Chi-yeol, as he steadily shakes off his armour to reveal the soft side of his character in the course of the show’s run.One of Crash Course in Romance’s stand-outs is the young Roh Yoon-seo as the fresh-faced and principled Hae-yi. She has only appeared in two other roles, both of which also made an impression – as a high schooler who falls pregnant in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Our Blues</span></a> and the girl whose crush falls for her best friend in the Netflix romance <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">20th Century Girl</span></a>.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/03/07/30913c16-f603-423d-9cab-d944f42739cd_d79d3104.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The violence of the serial killer plot jarred occasionally, particularly the recurring instances of stray cats being killed (thankfully not on screen), but Crash Course in Romance has otherwise been a broadly appealing K-drama series with something for everyone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Crash Course in Romance is streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLhuvM6pZqRllKeurq2OmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkWppbnFoZLumwMWloLFlm2Kxs63MmmSrnaaesrh5wquYrKBdmLy2vtKeZKunnZa7pLGMo5yopl2ZvG7FxKilZqKlo7Rut9iupaBlmKR6qbXTZpurmZ2WeqS%2BwKyfZqSRo7G0ec6uqQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mafs-jake-edwards-shares-dental-transformation-dramatic-photos-html.html><span>←</span><span>MAFS: Jake Edwards shares his dental transformation in dramatic before and after photos</span></a>
