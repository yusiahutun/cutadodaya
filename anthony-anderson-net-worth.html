Anderson was selected as the host of the 2024 Primetime Emmy Awards and stars with his mother, Doris Bowman, on the music-centric game show We Are Family.</p><p>Born on August 15, 1970, Anderson’s mother was a telephone operator and actor herself. His first attempt at forging a career in stand-up comedy was a failure, but having formed a bond with Guy Torry, he was consoled and inspired to take another shot at showbusiness. He enrolled in Howard University as a theater major but struggled financially which led him to leave after his junior year. His first TV appearance was in 1995 but it was perhaps in 2000 in Big Momma’s House that he got his big break. Since then, he’s appeared in shows like Entourage, The Bernie Mack Show, and is best known for his role as Andre ‘Dre’ Johnson in Black-Ish, on which he also serves as executive producer. The show ran for eight seasons from 2014 to 2022.</p><p>In December 2023, Anderson was announced as the host of the Emmy Awards. “With our industry’s recent challenges behind us, we can get back to what we love—dressing up and honoring ourselves. And there’s no better celebratory moment to bring the creative community together than the milestone 75th Emmy Awards,” Anderson said in a statement. “When FOX asked me to host this historic telecast, I was over the moon that Taylor Swift was unavailable, and now I can’t wait to be part of the biggest night in television,” he added.</p><p>Here’s everything we know about Anthony Anderson’s net worth and his salaries for the Emmys hosting gig and Black-Ish.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=15.299513551077><h2>Anthony Anderson's net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1762751958.jpg><p><a rel=nofollow href=#>Anthony Anderson’s net worth</a> is around $25 million according to Celebrity Net Worth. In January 2023, upon the announcement that he would be hosting a new music-centric game show with his mother Doris, he revealed that she once asked to borrow from him a large sum of money. He had once promised to buy her a house, but here’s how the exchange went down.</p><p>“When I say money, it wasn’t just like $1,500,” he told The Messenger. “No, it was like money money because it’s your mama. ‘Mama, <a href=# rel=nofollow>why are you asking me for $50,000</a>?’ She wouldn’t come like, ‘Hey baby, I need $5,000. I am a little behind on something.’ My mother came to me and asked me for 50 grand. I get it, you my mama, but you ain’t gonna get that kind of money.”</p><p>He explained that while he was earning a decent living from his various TV and movie roles, it takes a lot to have that sort of cash just on hand. “It’s not a loan,” he joked. “I told her that I’m not gonna do it.” But he did the next best thing. He didn’t buy her the house but he did give her the means to buy it herself.</p><p>“Don’t let my mama hear you say that because she will correct you and be like, ‘He ain’t bought me sh-—,'” he laughed. “I gave her the job and the opportunity for her to purchase her own home. That’s how she will tell it to you. I didn’t really buy it. But I gave you the job so that you can buy it.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.2462203023758><h2>Anthony Anderson's Emmy's salary</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Emmys-2.jpg><p>While an Emmy host’s salary hasn’t been specifically disclosed, Anthony Anderson is expected to make around $20,000. In 2013 for Seth Macfarlane’s Oscars hosting duties, the Hollywood Reporter found that <a href=#>Macfarlane was paid above the $15,000 SAG-AFTRA</a> minimum. Accounting for inflation, that would be just under $20,000 in 2024 so we have to assume the Emmys host receives around the same amount.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Anthony Anderson's Black-Ish salary</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anthony-anderson-blackish.jpg><p>When Anthony Anderson joined Black-Ish, he was earning around $100,000 for each episode, though reportedly that went up to $400,000 for later seasons. That works out to be around $8.8 million per year before taxes.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=11.165758401453><h2>Anthony Anderson's divorce settlement</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anthony-anderson-wife.jpg><p>In September 2023, news broke that Anthony Anderson and his wife of 22 years, Alvina, had settled their divorce 19 months after initially announcing their split for the second time. Alvina previously filed for divorce in 2015 but the couple seemed to overcome their differences and the petition for their first divorce was scrapped in 2017.</p><p>Then, on March 25, 2022, Alvina filed for divorce for a second time. She sought spousal support as well as payment of her attorney fees. In court documents obtained by People, Anderson was <a href=# rel=nofollow>ordered to pay his former spouse</a> a monthly base amount of $20,000. In the event that the Black-ish actor’s gross income exceeds “$2,000,000 per year,” he would be required to pay Alvina 20 percent of that gross amount, which would increase her payment to $400,000.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
