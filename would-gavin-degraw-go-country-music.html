Between collaborations with big-name country stars and his co-owned venture, Nashville Underground, with his brother Joey, the "Sweeter" singer admits a country album of his own wouldn't be too unexpected.</p><p>"If the market would have me, of course I would," he says of&nbsp;whether he would ever 'go&nbsp;country.' "Every time I'm invited to do something in the country world, I jump at the chance, because I love the fact that the song is the king — that's what they value here. They value the story, they value the realness of the material."</p><p>"That's a beautiful thing and that's the most enticing element of the country world of music," DeGraw adds.</p><p><strong>Brett Young's Live "In Case&nbsp;You Didn't Know" Will Give You Chills</strong></p><p>Nashville has been DeGraw's home for the past 10 years. He provided background vocals when <a href=#>Sara Evans</a> covered his hit "Not Over You" on her&nbsp;Slow Me Down&nbsp;album and <a href=#>dueted</a> with <a href=#>Martina McBride</a> in Nashville on his hit "Soldier," as well as soul icon Sam Cooke's "Bring It on Home to Me" in 2014. He opened for <a href=#>Shania Twain</a> during her Rock This Country Tour in 2015 and has&nbsp;in the past shared&nbsp;a stage with <a href=#>Luke Bryan</a> and <a href=#>Craig Morgan</a>.</p><p>"These groups of people in country, I just feel a certain camaraderie with them because I feel like they are genuine people, they're not just artists out there making product. These are people, and that's what's beautiful about the country world," he says.&nbsp;"It's just a very refreshing environment to be in. I don't see that sort of camaraderie in all genres of music. The country world really is a community world."</p><p>DeGraw helped define&nbsp;the mid-2000s radio scene with hits like "Chariot,"&nbsp;"In Love With a Girl"&nbsp;and "I Don't Want to Be," the latter of which solidified its place in pop culture as the official theme song to One Tree Hill.</p><p>The connection&nbsp;this singer-songwriter&nbsp;has with the country music&nbsp;community is personal —&nbsp;DeGraw&nbsp;recalls his first performance at CMA Festival in 2018 when, plagued by allergies, the crowd supported him by singing along&nbsp;with every word of his songs, despite it being a mostly country lineup of acts otherwise. He feels a distinct sense of gratification when he walks down Broadway and hears one of his songs being played by a cover band.</p><p>"I can't say enough how lucky I feel just to be here and be part of something so special, this whole community," he admits. "I never chose my genres, I just wrote songs, and those songs were kind of put out there in those genres and those genres have been very good to me ... But I've always identified as a songwriter specifically and I think that the country world really still does honor the songwriter. So if that's where my love is going to be, then that's where I'll lean."</p><p>"If you'll have me, then I'll make the record," he concludes.</p><p>DeGraw is slated to perform at 2019 <a href=#>CMA Fest</a>&nbsp;at the Riverfront Stage on June 7.</p><p><strong>These Artists Unexpectedly Went Country:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmsKelobFus8CvoKdllJq0s63WZp6oZZOkwq%2FA0bJkpq2jnrBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./19-nutrition-facts-smoked-salmon.html><span>←</span><span>19 Nutrition Facts Smoked Salmon</span></a>
