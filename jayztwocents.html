Is JayzTwoCents married?&nbsp;Where does JayzTwoCents live?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>JayzTwoCents (real name: Jason Langevin) is an American YouTuber and internet personality. He is best known for his YouTube channels “JayzTwoCents” and “JayzTwoCars.”</p><p>Jason vlogs about gaming and technology with a lighthearted slant.</p><h2><strong>The Origin Story</strong></h2><p>Langevin was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on June 3rd, 1981.</p><p>He grew up in Rialto, California.</p><p>He has stated that he had an interest in PCs from a young age, and began opening his PCs up at the age of ten to figure out what made them tick.</p><p>JayzTwoCents did not go into higher education; instead, he began to work in IT at the age of 16 as a computer networking consultant.</p><h2><strong>YouTube</strong></h2><p><br>Langevin’s first channel was entitled ‘JaysVFX,’ which he used to post Call of Duty montages and video edits. However, he quickly found this dissatisfying and believed that he had more to offer the world than simple VFX work.</p><p>He, therefore, abandoned his original channel to find his most famous one, ‘JayzTwoCents.’</p><p>On that YouTube channel, Langevin focused on technology – specifically how to build PCs and how to understand both the hardware and software aspects of PCs.</p><p>Langevin’s videos on the channel were noted for their casual and comedic aspects, which helped to make them accessible to the layman and ensure that casual viewers were not overwhelmed with esoteric technical jargon that might alienate them.</p><p>As the channel grew in popularity, Langevin branched out into other aspects of PC culture, including benchmarking new video-game titles, FPS counts on various games, exploring vintage technology such as gaming computers from the 1980s, and much more.</p><p>Langevin’s channel became a huge hit, and as of 2023 has 3.9 million subscribers.</p><p>Although he has since divided his attention between this and a new channel, Langevin still uploads several new videos a week, and enjoys a devoted fanbase.</p><p>In 2012, Langevin began his second channel, entitled “JayzTwoCars.” This channel was ostensibly devoted to cars, but there was a lot of crossover with Langevin’s personal life, and he would often post about his personal travails – including his struggles with weight loss.</p><p>Langevin also posted ‘slice-of-life’ videos to the channel. These included following him on mundane daily activities (such as grocery shopping) but also included family vacations, such as taking his kids to Disneyworld.</p><p>“JayzTwoCars” enjoyed moderate success, but did not reach the heights of his primary channel.</p><p>As of 2023, it has around 266,000 subscribers – a fraction of those enjoyed by JayzTwoCents.</p><p>Perhaps as a result of the relatively low number of viewers on this channel, then, it has been somewhat neglected since 2022, with no new uploads since June of that year.</p><h2><strong>Weight Problems</strong></h2><p>Langevin previously struggled with his weight a great deal, at one stage weighing over 500 pounds.&nbsp;</p><p>In September 2019, he posted on his Twitter account:</p><p>”Haven’t posted anything fitness in a while. #goteamjay is still on course, and the fat loss and muscle growth is coming along nicely.” Jason added: ”Down 26lbs on top of whatever muscle I’ve gained. The recent drama has been great workout fuel! These are 180lb low rows.”</p><p>He eventually had weight-loss surgery in order to help him reach a healthy size.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Tony Evans Biography</a></p><h2><strong>Wife</strong></h2><p>JayzTwoCents is a married man, but his wife’s name was not disclosed to the public. She has a Twitter profile named – MrsJayzTwoCents.</p><h2><strong>Children</strong></h2><p>Jason has two daughters.</p><p>His wife and daughters have appeared in several of his YouTube videos.</p><h2><strong>Height</strong></h2><p>Langevin is 6 feet 2 inches tall.</p><h2><strong>Location</strong></h2><p>JayzTwoCents is currently located in Claremont.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Harley Morenstein Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Quotes</strong></h2><p><br>”So, as of today, I’ve had tons of AMD fanboys come after us, as well as upset messages/calls from both AMD and MSI.”</p><p>”Jay-Z did an interview, and now my feed is full of people congratulating me on an amazing interview… or calling me some very angry name.”</p><p>”The reality here is the brands want to provide us personal fast lane service that I don’t believe the customer gets.”</p><p>”If we are influencers, then why are we to base our opinions on the products that aren’t what the “influenced” are receiving.”</p><h2><strong>Trivia</strong></h2><p>Jason has posted collaborative videos with Jerry Berg, the creator of the Barnacules Nerdgasm YouTube channel. Berg can type more than 120 words per minute.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>What is the net worth of Alisha Marie</a>?</p><h2><strong>JayzTwoCents – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Jason earned most of his wealth from streaming on Twitch, sponsors, and advertisements on his YouTube channels.</p><p>Currently, he has over 883 million views. But, how much do all these views earn him?</p><p>Earnings on YouTube depend on several factors, including:</p><ul><li>Keywords;</li><li>Seasonality;</li><li>The Video Topic;</li><li>Competition In The Market;</li><li>The Quality Of The Ads;</li><li>Ad Skipping.</li></ul><p>On average, 100,000 views on YouTube can bring a YouTuber around $300. Hence, his 993 million views have earned Jason around $3 million before taxes.</p><p>He sells merch on store.jayztwocents.com.</p><p>Therefore, JayzTwoCents has an estimated net worth of $2 million.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>Who is Carl Lentz</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfn666xtOwppydnqnAcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-watch-ufc-283-teixeira-vs-hill-live-online.html><span>←</span><span>How to Watch UFC 283 Teixeira vs Hill Live Online</span></a>
