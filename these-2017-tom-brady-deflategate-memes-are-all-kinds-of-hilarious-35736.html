With dislike of the Patriots at an all-time high due to President Donald Trump rooting for the team, people have begun creating <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>2017 Deflategate memes about Tom Brady</a>, the Patriots quarterback for whom <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Trump has so much love</a>.</p><p>For those who aren't as well versed in sports lore, there's no way to understate the importance of <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the Deflategate scandal</a> in American football. Brady was accused of having a role in deflating footballs during the Patriots' American Football Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts to help the Pats win 45-7, and was <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>suspended by the National Football League</a> for his alleged role. What followed was a long and litigious back-and-forth between the Patriots and the NFL, and by the summer of 2016, Brady could have <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>appealed his suspension to the Supreme Court</a> had he not decided against the move. With the Patriots and Brady in the Super Bowl again, the scandal has once again become prominent on social media. Nobody knows the truth about Brady's role in Deflategate 2015, but Twitter surely has taken its stance with these hilarious memes.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">Brady Is So Serious About This</h2></p><p>If anyone were to make irreverent jokes about sports, it would be fans of the always-controversial World Star Hip Hop.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">When Memes Collide</h2></p><p>With the inclusion of 2016's <a href=# rel=noreferrer>"Arthur fist" meme</a>, this joke pokes fun not only at Brady, but at the memetic quality that Deflategate has taken since 2015.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">The "Inner Kermit" Meme Strikes Again</h2></p><p>"Arthur fist" isn't the only 2016 meme to enter the fray of 2017 Deflategate memes.
