Then I decided to keep him, but informed him that we would not be on speaking terms until the small hand on the clock hit the 8. Then he rolled over and <a href=#>looked so pleased himself</a> that it broke my will. So I rifled through the fridge, tossed some items left and right, found some sour cream leftover from <a href=#>last week’s muffins</a> and decided I may as well make some breakfast.</p><p><span id=more-5610></span></p><p><a title="gloppy sour cream" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4042/4297296103_c22618fd7c_n.jpg alt="gloppy sour cream" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="mixing the batter" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2781/4298042046_28d51145b7_n.jpg alt="mixing the batter" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="two eggs and a bit of vanilla" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4298047942_a0ca1a7390_n.jpg alt="two eggs and a bit of vanilla" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="melting butter in cast iron" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm5.static.flickr.com/4071/4297297285_a68c85c682_n.jpg alt="melting butter in cast iron" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Pancakes, to be specific. And not just pancakes, but sour cream pancakes. And not just any sour cream pancakes but <a href=#>Ree Drummond’s Husband’s Grandma Edna Mae’s Sour Cream Pancakes</a>, which I suspect were always served before 8 a.m. I mean, <a href=#>I’ve been out to that ranch</a>, I know how early they wake up, and curiously, with a lot less complaint that yours truly. Maybe I can send Jacob out there next time?</p><p><a title="stack of sour cream pancakes" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2689/4298046244_fc0987bc30_z.jpg alt="stack of sour cream pancakes" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>I liked these pancakes. They took no time to put together, they kept that tangy sour cream flavor I adore, and they were barely sweet which is an essential contrast when you drown your pancakes in as much maple syrup as we here do. Next time, however, I look forward to eating them at the proper weekend hour of noon.</p><p><a title="also mine" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/farm3.static.flickr.com/2800/4297598191_2d3b5c08f3_z.jpg alt="also mine" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>Chicken Milanese and an Escarole Salad</a><br><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>Leek and Swiss Chard Tart</a><br><b>Three years ago:</b> <a href=#>Sweet and Spicy Candied Pecans</a></p><p><b>Edna Mae’s Sour Cream Pancakes</b><br>Adapted from <a href=#>The Pioneer Woman Cooks</a></p><p>Ree says this makes 12 4-inch pancakes; I got 8 that were closer to 5 inches</p><p>7 tablespoons (60 grams) all-purpose flour<br>1 tablespoon (13 grams) sugar<br>1 teaspoon baking soda<br>1/2 teaspoon salt<br>1 cup (240 grams) sour cream (I swapped some with yogurt when I realized I was short, to no ill-effect)<br>2 large eggs<br>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>Butter, as needed<br>Maple syrup (or perhaps some <a href=#>Cranberry Syrup</a>)</p><p>Heat a cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-low heat; you want it to slowly get nice and hot.</p><p>Stir the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt together in the bottom of a medium bowl. Dump the sour cream in on top and stir it together very gently; it’s okay to leave the texture a bit uneven. Whisk the eggs and vanilla in a separate bowl and stir them into the sour cream mixture, once again, being careful not to overmix.</p><p>Melt about a tablespoon of butter in your skillet or griddle and pour the batter in, a scant 1/4 cup at a time. Cook for about 2 minutes on the first side, or until bubbles appear all over the surface [See <a href=#>Pancakes 101</a> for this and other tips], flipping them carefully and cooking for about a minute on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</p><p>Serve in a stack, topped with a pat of butter and a cascade of maple syrup.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-5610 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-5610 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
