The <a href=#>#CleartheList</a>&nbsp;social media initiative finds teachers — especially those in underfunded schools — seeking outside support to purchase things they'll use to teach kids. Her wish list included art supplies, building materials, animal figurines and more.</p><p>"Cleared it for ya. Good luck to your students and GO APPS!" Combs wrote in&nbsp;response to her request.</p><p>Combs didn't actually finish his education at Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C., dropping out with one month remaining in his senior year. He remains tied to the school, however, and was even on track to&nbsp;perform in their football stadium before the pandemic canceled that idea in the summer of 2020.</p><p>He doesn't tweet often,&nbsp;and lately it's been about one-on-one fan experiences. On Saturday, for example, he recognized a fan whose father he shared a drink with during a concert.</p><p>After a few warmup dates, Combs' What You See Is What You Get Tour will begin in earnest on Sept. 10 in (coincidentally) Raleigh, N.C. "Cold&nbsp;as You" is his newest single from the What You See Is What You Get album. He's thought to be working on new music currently.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top Country Songs of 2021, Ranked</h2><p>You'll find much more than just the Top 10 Country Songs of 2021 on this list.</p>Our team has sourced fans to create 10 superlatives for this mid-year version of the year-end songs list.
