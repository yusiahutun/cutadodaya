eagam8p0"></span> I wear makeup to feel good about myself. I want to feel empowered, I want to feel like the best version of myself. <span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To that point, we asked Beckham if she was concerned that the way we interact with makeup is forever changed post-COVID? "I'm not worried about that at all," she tells BAZAAR.com. "For me, I wear makeup to feel good about myself. I want to feel empowered, I want to feel like the best version of myself. I mean, wearing a mask doesn't stop me from wearing my lipstick, you know?" Her lipsticks are called Posh, after all.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beckham says she's used her time in quarantine to experiment with different makeup looks. Though like so many of us, she's had to take her entire beauty routine into her own hands. "I've really enjoyed that," she adds. "I've enjoyed time with Harper doing home facials for example, home manicures, using hair masks, and that sort of thing."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unsurprisingly, Beckham hasn't given herself over to the siren call of sweatpants just yet. "I haven't been one of these people that have turned to elasticated waist and no makeup," she says. "I don't wear makeup for other people I really do wear it for myself, it makes me feel good. Even if I go to the gym, I like to make sure that I've got my skincare on, I've got a bit of lipstick on, and I've got my mascara on. Even when I'm having a non-makeup day, I like to make a bit of an effort because because that's just how I am."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of all the pieces in the collection, we've been turning to Beckham's new mascara on our no-makeup days, simply because the formula boosts lashes enough for Zoom calls but washes off with just warm water at the end of the day. The designer says she worked with her team for a "long time" to nail down a "clean" mascara formula that felt fresh and cool (not "clunky") while also conditioning your lashes underneath. "I personally don't love that look of lots and lots of heavy product," she says. "I respect that everybody likes different things, but that isn't what I wanted. I wanted something that felt modern."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beckham's definition of modernity isn't actually rooted in 2021. "When I first embarked on this journey, myself and Sarah Creal wanted to create a beauty brand of the future. So really focusing on clean formulas, sustainability, and making everything that we do inclusive—that was really key. There is so much that we want to do," she says. Sustainability touches every corner of the brand. The products are housed in sturdy glass with minimal plastic, come with 100 percent post-consumer waste secondary packaging, and are shipped using corn-based materials that are recyclable and/or biodegradable. Each order is delivered in a reusable canvas pouch, and the brand provides an online guide about recycling the products. As for the ingredients, VBB adheres to the European Commission standard of clean and non-toxic and it's entirely cruelty-free.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I think what we're putting on our faces is very important<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think we all have a responsibility," says Beckham. "When I started doing research, I really wanted to know what was in the products that I was using, what was in the products that my daughter was using, and it was very much a gray area. I think what we're putting on our faces is very important." But what the products are packaged in is just as key as the formulas inside, and where Beckham did not want to compromise an inch was on performance or luxury. "That's something that kind of surprised me through this process and it's definitely been a challenge for the team. There's a reason why not a lot of people are doing this. It is much more challenging, but a challenge that we have already embraced and something that we're all very proud of."<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That commitment to the environment extends to the Beckham household, too. "Harper and I literally went through the house removing all the plastic water bottles and looking at absolutely everything that was in our house," she says. "It's great for me to educate myself and for me to educate my kids as well. I mean, Harper is 9 years old and the fact that she wants to know what's in her shampoo and she's asking these questions—I think that it's great. As parents, we have a responsibility to educate our kids and being kind to ourselves and kind the the planet is something that we take very, very seriously."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content.
