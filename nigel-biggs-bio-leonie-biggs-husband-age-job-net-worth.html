In the summer of the year, the two drifters were off in different directions to see the world. Leonie’s plan was to journey to Melbourne and Nigel was to Canberra. Their path crossed and they have been together ever since.</p><p>After eight years of meeting each other, Nigel and Leonie exchanged their wedding vows in January 2010. On their 12th anniversary in January 2022, Leonie posted a photo that she calls a “treasure” because it was the first photo taken of them (using a disposable camera, so before the digital age).</p><p>It was also the first gift a penny-less Nigel ever gave to her. She wrote in the caption, “It was so emotional as it was his ‘forget me not’ just prior to us parting ways to start jobs in different states (or so we thought). Moreover, it was the first time I realized that I actually loved someone…just didn’t have the courage to say so back then (it took me a few more years later). Luckily, I’m more expressive these days… for better or worse… Jokes aside…”</p><p>She concluded the post writing, “To my huckleberry friend, my constant, my Biggsy-boy, the father of our beautiful child…I love you and I thank you for being my best friend, and incredible father – I don’t think I’ve ever known someone who works so hard and is committed to what he puts his heart towards..C and I are so lucky we have your heart…and suffice to say, I’m taking you off that Hubby-PIP…Love you longtime, Wifey xoxoxo.”</p><p>The married couple shares one daughter named Charlotte. Born in the fall of 2015, Charlotte is 7 years old.</p><p>In 2023, his wife is starring in Bravo’s Dancing Queens as a ballroom dancer. According to her bio, Leonie “is a perfectionist who doesn’t like to take on anything unless she can be the best at it. With a full plate, she balances her life as a wife and mother with her high-powered career in finance. This dance season, Leonie has a new pro partner, Koysta Samarskyi, which adds stress, doubt, and additional hours of practicing before she feels ready to compete. Fiercely competitive in nature, she feels the pressure to be a championship ballroom dancer and beat out the other ladies to earn the coveted first place.”</p><p>Apart from dancing, Leonie is a model, and martial artist, and works in finance. According to her experience section, Leonie started working as an institutional trader at Patersons’ Securities in 1999. She rose to the position of senior account manager at HOSTPLUS after four years of employment there. Her subsequent position was as an IBD Associate at Goldman Sachs, but after a year and a half there, she changed employers and was appointed head of UK operations at Alternative Investment Management Products (UK) Limited.</p><p>She began working at PwC LLP in 2014 as a Management Consultant – Asset Management. She is still employed there, according to her LinkedIn profile, and she is also a lifestyle model and an entrepreneur philanthropist.</p><h3><strong>Nigel Biggs Age</strong></h3><p>In 2023, Nigel Biggs is above 44 years old.</p><h3><strong>Nigel Biggs Job</strong></h3><p>Nigel Biggs is working as director of PwC Consulting since 2016.
