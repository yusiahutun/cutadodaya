Every time she walks into an audition, she’s surrounded by an intimidating array of other redheads, all waiting to read for the same role. It’s a plight many working actors can relate to; there are few other professions where you get such an up-close-and-personal look at the competition. But once those aspiring actors hit the big time, the experience also makes for fascinating stories. On red carpets during this awards season, we asked celebrities to spill about the actors who beat them out for roles earlier in their careers. Many demurred — that’s Hollywood for you — but a few were bold enough to name names.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1ff/8c8/7235e601a830b1ed1b95f80f7c393c3de0-21-losing-roles-jones-dawson.rsquare.w400.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizhh8jzp00q5xvy6ksj9m7ci@published data-word-count=2><strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizhh8jzm00q4xvy6bkljqh3m@published data-word-count=89>“Charlie Cox and I used to go to the same auditions together and neither of us would get it!

My complexion, bald, hunk, beautiful — and I would lose it to him. Every time. If I’m doing a comedy audition, I always felt like, I can do this one. But if it was a drama audition, I’d walk in, there’s fuckin’ Coby Bell and that was it. The other one was Michael Jai White.

It’s kind of confusing. I mean, it changes a lot. In the beginning, I didn’t lose parts but I’d get stuff that either Gary Oldman wasn’t interested in, or Phillip Seymour Hoffman wasn’t interested in. It’s kind of a weird range. It’s a very odd thing to find out who ends up doing stuff that you [auditioned for]. I went in for <i>Westworld</i> for Anthony Hopkins’s part. [Laughs.] Yeah, it’s weird. Game of Thrones, the part that Jonathan Pryce did. It’s kind of a strange thing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/d6e/b34/f8acd5a25ebb21c26eec3652b0fa815e70-21-losing-roles-harris-hoffman.h473.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizhh8kau002oayyeeh5vh9jl@published data-word-count=2><strong>Missi Pyle</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizhh8kcg002payye073gmg04@published data-word-count=235>“There are like four of them. Judy Greer is one, and she usually gets the role. Judy gets almost all of them. Another actress who people say looks exactly like me is Elaine Hendrix, from Parent Trap. People are always coming up to me to to tell me how much they loved me in The Parent Trap. It depends on how I’m feeling if I say, ‘Well, that was actually Elaine Hendrix.’ Then maybe I’ll text her and say, ‘Hey, I’m in Mexico and I just want to tell you that you have a lot of fans here.’ I was at the airport once and someone was like, ‘Hey, I loved in you in Parent Trap,’ and I just was like [sigh], ‘Thanks.’ But then that caused 50 more people to come over because they were on a school trip. So now I’m liar. The roles that killed me though, that I think I was up for, were these two parts that Elizabeth Banks got instead of me. It was for Hunger Games and her part in those episodes on 30 Rock. I think those were my best auditions, and well, she got them. That’s the life! I also get a lot of roles that no one else is available for. Like, I recently got a role that they wanted Cher for. If Cher is not available, apparently I’m the next person they think of.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f5a/4b2/4404d6241a19374a6561bbefbfbba6bb74-21-losing-roles-pyle-greer.h473.w710.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizhh8k5f002kayyeg2702ha2@published data-word-count=2><strong>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cizhh8kug002wayye47vx5ovf@published data-word-count=18>“Demi Moore, Elizabeth Perkins, those two names come to mind.

You know, I wouldn’t see them but people like Sean Penn or Nicholas Cage, sometimes you’d go up for things. But there are certain actors that you’ve worked a lot with, like Tony Shalhoub. I’ve worked with Tony, sometimes he’s done parts, we’ve interchanged back and forth, and we’ve also worked together a lot too. I love Tony, so you know, a lot of times it has to do with how you look. I think the major thing is, both Tony and I went to Yale drama school so we’re able to do different kinds of things. You have to turn that into a big advantage. I’ve played all different kinds of people, if you can do that, if you have the training to do it … You have to know that because people are kind of pigeonholed immediately, put in a box, you have to break out of it constantly.

That was the first time I met Fran. I got the job. We were sitting together and had signed something like seven-year contracts while sitting next to each other. I got the job, and after the pilot, I was fired. Someone else was hired to do like six episodes of the series. I always remember that because there I was with Frances McDormand, who is one of my favorite actresses.

It was kind of hard, because I’d literally be like, ‘I lost to that guy, again!’ And then I’d see him at the gym, the 24-hour Fitness in Sherman Oaks and now we’re actually friends. We talk about that, and it was like, ‘Man seriously, get off my radar because you’re taking all my jobs.’ [One role I lost was] the Wolverine movie that was set in Tokyo, Japan.
