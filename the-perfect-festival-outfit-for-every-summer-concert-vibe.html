And if you happen not to have any festivals lined up this summer, don’t sweat it.

As you celebrate rock, hip-hop, and electronic&nbsp;musicians and artists during this camping festival located on a 700-acre farm, don’t forget about the other attractions, like yoga and waterslides. So if you’re looking to keep cool, wear a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one-piece swimsuit</a>, and make it double as a bodysuit paired with shorts. If denim shorts aren’t your vibe, opt for sweat-resistant <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">biker shorts</a> in a festival-approved print for yoga (and for mosh pits, of course). And let’s not forget the importance of a good sneaker, especially on the camping grounds.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Summerfest_Outfits></span>Summerfest Outfits<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.refinery29.com/images/11431052.png><p><strong>When:</strong> June 22-July 8</p><p><strong>Where:</strong> Henry Maier Festival Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin</p><p><strong>What to Wear:</strong> “The world’s largest music festival” is celebrating its 55th anniversary this year. Jam out to classic rock, country, and blues music in country-esque attire (we’re thinking a bandana top). Wear a packable straw hat that you can roll up into your <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">concert bag</a> when the sun goes down and slip into a pair of cowboy boots with cushioned soles to trek between the 12 stages.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Rolling_Loud_Outfits></span>Rolling Loud Outfits<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2.wp.com/www.refinery29.com/images/11431191.png><p><strong>When:</strong> July 21-23</p><p><strong>Where:</strong> Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Florida</p><p><strong>What to Wear:</strong> If you’re not attending the previous large-scale festival, maybe you’ll be going to “the biggest hip-hop festival in the world” — Rolling Loud. While it happens several times a year in different locations, summer 2023 is reserved for Miami. Shield your eyes from the sun with a holographic visor that’s just as stylish as it is protective. Keep the rest of your festival outfit cool and casual, pairing a crop top with breathable parachute pants, dad sneakers, and a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">belt bag</a>.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lollapalooza_Outfits></span>Lollapalooza Outfits<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.refinery29.com/images/11431201.png><p><strong>When:</strong> August 3-6</p><p><strong>Where:</strong> Grant Park in Chicago, Illinois</p><p><strong>What to Wear:</strong> Lollapalooza festival outfits are comparable to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Coachella</a> style. Think boho and peace and love and color and — yes — lots of tassels and fringe. As you dance alongside Chicago’s skyline to alternative rock, hip-hop, and techno anthems, do so in a funky crocheted top or shorts. Accessorize with a fun <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pair of sunnies</a> that you can also hang around your neck and a pair of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">platform sneakers</a> to peek over the bustling crowds.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Outside_Lands_Outfits></span>Outside Lands Outfits<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.refinery29.com/images/11431203.png><p><strong>When:</strong> August 11-13</p><p><strong>Where:</strong> Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California</p><p><strong>What to Wear:</strong> At this all-ages festival, there’s a broad range of genres, from rock and pop to dance and funk, and more, so the summer festival outfit options are endless. Consider going for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">denim pieces with a twist</a> or combat boots with a twist (i.e., metallic platform ones). And if you plan on dancing all night long inside SOMA Tent where the DJs never stop playing, go for a pair of neon glow-in-the-dark glasses to stand out.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Electric_Zoo_Outfits></span>Electric Zoo Outfits<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.refinery29.com/images/11431313.png><p><strong>When:</strong> September 1-3</p><p><strong>Where:</strong> Randall’s Island in New York, New York</p><p><strong>What to Wear:</strong> Ravers unite and, well, rave, during this Labor Day Weekend EDM festival. Take over Randall’s Island in style with a tiny chain mail top and metallic biker shorts. When it gets too hot and steamy to bear, pull out your fan to cool down yourself and your festival mates. And as any raver knows, Kandi bracelets (aka <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">friendship bracelets</a>) are meant to be swapped with others, so grab some pre-made ones from Amazon to help spread the love.</p><p>DashDividers_1_500x100</p><p>At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.
