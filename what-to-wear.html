Rule number one when you’re working from home? Get up, get dressed, and make the important distinction between your living and working space.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With that being said, there has to be some kind of trade-off for not seeing your friends and family, or being able to go to your favourite restaurant, for the next few months. So most women are now taking advantage: going make-up free, taking a much-needed break from heated hair tools and, of course, dressing down for a day at the 'office'.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, if a tidy house is a tidy mind, then motivation and bothering to brush your teeth go hand-in-hand. Not that you should be sitting at your kitchen table in a pair of loafers and a tailored trouser suit everyday – there has to be a happy medium. Comfort is key, but comfortable can still be chic.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now is the time to channel the kind of carefree, low-maintenance look that only comes with a lighter schedule and lack of commute. Enter: the smock dress. Voluminous in shape, generous in fit, unstructured in its construction and usually made of a lightweight fabric like cotton or linen. It exudes a sense of effortlessness that we’re always coveting, but unable to achieve while weighed down by heavy boots, coats and a spare tote slung over our shoulders.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The smock is obviously comfortable, but it's also super easy to dress up or down, and takes all of five seconds to slip on in the morning (nothing should come between you and your new-found daily lie-ins). What’s more, there’s an alleged heatwave approaching, so you’ll be grateful for its breeziness when things start to get a little too warm for your cashmere joggers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Right now, Monikh Dale is championing this working-from-home staple on Instagram. Her go-to look is a big dress, bare feet and a low-sweeping bun. Maybe a pair of earrings if she’s feeling fancy for a Friday night House Party date. It’s become such a signature that her followers are now posting 'Monikh inspired' #ootd pictures.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of course, Dale is not the first to have channeled this look. This oversized smock style has been part of every fashion editor’s holiday wardrobe list since Three Graces London ramped up its ready-to-wear efforts back in 2018 (Heidi Klum and Selena Gomez are big fans).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then along came Cecilie Bahnsen with her tiered day dresses, and soon this look was just as appropriate with a pair of biker boots as it was with flip flops. We told you it was a versatile piece.</p><img alt="Street Style - Day 2 - Copenhagen Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2020" title="Street Style - Day 2 - Copenhagen Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2020" width=3648 height=5205 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1167254522.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Christian Vierig</span></p><img alt="Street Style - Day 2 - Copenhagen Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2020" title="Street Style - Day 2 - Copenhagen Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2020" width=5288 height=3500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1167254565.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Christian Vierig</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is why we suggest you invest in one as soon as possible. It's perfect for feeling pulled-together while confined to your house but, rest assured, you’ll still want to wear it once the quarantine ends – here's how:<br></p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The maxi</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fashion's favourite kind of smock dress, without a doubt, is the maxi – and a lightweight cotton-poplin, gauze or linen should be your fabric of choice, to maintain its impressive structure without feeling too weighty. Long sleeves and pure white colourways always look romantic, but Three Graces' sleeveless yellow iteration sold out at lightning speed last summer (check out & Other Stories' take below).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When you're WFH, style this dress with a low bun, bare feet and a fresh face. Then, take it outside of the house with leather slides and lashing of gold jewellery. Enjoy the generous fit now, while comfort is king, then cinch it with a waist belt to switch things up.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The mini<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When a tiered dress is slashed to the mid-thigh, it creates a voluminous, trapezoid finish. This shape is delightfully girlish, nodding to children's' babydolls and pinafores, while actually being very flattering on the figure – it'll slim your legs and cover any lumps and bumps.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Wear yours now with a headband and cropped cardigans, then opt for stompy hiking shoes, cowboy boots or flatforms once quarantine is over.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The midi</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While less playful than a mini or maxi, the midi smock is by far the easiest to slot into your everyday wardrobe. Go for long sleeves and high necks for a relaxed, prairie-inspired look. Or, if you prefer to show a hint of skin, Lisa Marie Fernandez' one-shoulder iteration is just as comfortable when you remove the sash belt.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Keen to look ahead during this period? COS has the answer with a collared iteration, which is loose enough to relax in but easily smartened up when you finally get back to the office.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In need of some at-home inspiration? <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/cr.aspx?ID=szpklLhpWonj6JnlBH3GzpALHvm1ZwMa0oU9UEP6sYg4RDPmqEfyeN1vIR80j83YlJMODbnaXySUsa" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sign up to our free weekly newsletter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sign up to our free weekly newsletter</a> for skincare and self-care, the latest cultural hits to read and download, and the little luxuries that make staying in so much more satisfying.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/cr.aspx?ID=szpklLhpWonj6JnlBH3GzpALHvm1ZwMa0oU9UEP6sYg4RDPmqEfyeN1vIR80j83YlJMODbnaXySUsa" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SIGN UP" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60"><strong>SIGN UP</strong></a></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Law Roach and Zendaya at the 2019 Met Gala" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/8a651e5a-7f48-48e1-832e-d6b713f4e6d1/thumb_1920x1080_00001_1557213819_88923.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmTEqa3TZquoZaearrN7wGxpaWlnZYRxe9KmppyjXZm%2Fpr%2FSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tarantula-named-lil-kim-loses-hair-butt-physical-stress-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tarantula 'Lil Kim' loses all hair on its bottom due to stress</span></a>
