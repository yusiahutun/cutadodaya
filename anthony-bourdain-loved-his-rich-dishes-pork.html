On the same page as a recipe for shanks or feet or head you’ll find a line drawing of a farm animal – mostly pigs – with the corresponding extremity missing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are sketches and photos of bacchanalian scenes of the dining room, with diners – wine glasses in hand – looking greedily at plates piled high with food. Other photos include pigs’ heads being simmered in an enormous pot, animals being processed and carcasses hanging in a meat fridge.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the introduction, Bourdain, who died in 2018, writes, “[Martin Picard’s] restaurant, Au Pied de Cochon in Montreal, is a celebration, an ode to all things porky, ducky, fatty and wonderful. A return to the hearth where all of us learned to cook – a place where, through the careful application of heat, magical things happen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/10/49b3fde3-5c18-4ce3-9147-785426b28ac0_fb357872.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In an open kitchen, behind a long, customer-friendly counter, he has created one of the Western world’s few ‘B***s***-Free Zones’, a place where it’s all about – and only about – what’s delicious, pleasurable and true – and where too much of a good thing is never enough […]</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Martin Picard’s genius – beyond having the impeccable sense and timing to realise that now, right now, is the perfect time to give the whole world of fine dining the middle finger – is that he knows who he is, what he loves to eat, where he comes from, what’s good – and how to best prepare it so as to most effectively allow others to discover what was good about it all along.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He understands how good these simple, pure, good things are – how much pleasure can be found in them. That he does not, apparently, see moderation as a virtue is – if anything – a refreshing perspective, particularly in these troubled times of ‘small plates’, raw food faddists, and cost-conscious chains.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The recipes that made Jiggs Kalra India’s first celebrity chef</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like so many chefs who choose to specialise in meat, Picard shows his respect to the animals he cooks by paying close attention to how they are raised, and then he takes care to use up every bit of them, so nothing goes to waste.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He writes, “[In opening Au Pied de Cochon] I found myself going against the current trend set by the media, who seem to have only bad things to say about pigs and those who breed them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In reality, the pigs themselves have nothing to do with any of this. The real debate concerns the way we collectively choose to raise animals slated for slaughter. To come down on the side of pork is to come down in favour of a style of cuisine which pays homage to this most versatile of animals, which can be eaten from one end to the other, from snout to tail […]</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“What I have decided to do at Au Pied de Cochon is to deal exclusively with one independently run farm, whose quality standards are higher than those in the industry in general and where I know the animals are raised in the best possible conditions.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/10/3f7a8ca0-19a9-4985-ac2f-04189641de4b_dae1cb15.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/10/b7d84773-1dbe-4585-80a9-ae5dfc02052d_be7df7de.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The book includes recipes for the famous foie gras poutine, as well as foie gras-stuffed pig’s feet, lamb shank confit, boudin maison, duck in a can, chicken pie, lobster roll, stuffed pig’s stomach, pot-au-feu, pickled venison tongue, pumpkin soup, fried pork rinds, zucchini flower tempura, mashed potatoes (which sounds decadently delicious: four potatoes flavoured with a whole head of roasted garlic, then mixed with 250 grams of cheese curds, 100 grams of butter and 200ml of full-fat cream), maple tart, and maple ice cream with cotton candy.</p>Like what you read?
