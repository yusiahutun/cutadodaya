All the while listening to her blasts from the past, such as "Symptoms of True Love" and "Tender Kisses," fans cannot stop but wonder what life is like for the 45-year-old singer now.</p><h2>What Is Life Like For Tracie?</h2><p>Many people to this day haven't forgotten Tracie for her charismatic smile, outstanding fashion statements, captivating aura, and her unique vocal skills, of course.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>But one question always remains in the minds of her fans, "does she have a husband?" and "how is life like for Tracie?"</p><p>Well, we don't mean to disappoint our readers, but Tracie has been fairly good in keeping her life outside the showbiz very low-key. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-180 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>So, her having a husband or a life partner is still a mystery, but she was once rumored to be in a relationship with Kenneth Karlin and Carsten Schack.</p><p>However, there were no confirmations to these relationships rumors, but she, Kenneth, and Carsten were the lyricists of the song, Unbelievable and Closer.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Spencer, now age 45, has stopped making music or appearing in the media industry, but the achievements that she has accomplished in her career since a very young age are commendable on their own.</p><p><strong>Another R&B Pop Singer:</strong> <a href=# rel=follow>Jasmine Villeges Happy To Be Dating Her Vine Star Boyfriend With Their New-Born Baby!</a></p><h2>Tasted Success At Young</h2><p>Spencer was very young when she hugged the field of music.
