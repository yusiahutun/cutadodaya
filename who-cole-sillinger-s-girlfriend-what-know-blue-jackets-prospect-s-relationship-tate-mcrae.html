The two began talking and went Instagram official in 2021, as she posted a photo of him on their vacation.</p><p>McRae started her career serving as a voice actress for the "Lalaloopsy" franchise from 2013 until 2015. She then began dancing competitively while still singing, she sang on stage with Justin Bieber at a 2016 concert in Calgary.</p><p>That same year, McRae appeared on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" and was also a contestant on "So You Think You Can Dance."</p><p>McRae's music career took off in 2017, years after she started posting on YouTube. In 2019, McRae signed with RCA Records and released her debut EP in January 2020.</p><p>Since her debut album, McRae released the single "You Broke Me First," which became her first song on Billboard Hot 100. It was also the longest charting song released by a female artist in 2020 on the Billboard Hot 100, at 38 weeks.</p><p>She has since had two headlining tours and is set for her third tour this fall.</p><h2>Cole Sillinger's NHL career</h2><p>Cole Sillinger, meanwhile, is entering his third <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>NHL</a> season and is projected to be on the third line.
