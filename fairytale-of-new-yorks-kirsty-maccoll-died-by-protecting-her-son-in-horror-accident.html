She was visiting Cozumel, Mexico, with her family after filming a <a href=#>TV</a> appearance in Cuba.

When they surfaced, a speedboat appeared despite them not being allowed in the area. It was traveling at a high speed, and though Louis, who was then 13, was not in the boat’s path, 15-year-old Jamie was.</p><p>Kirsty managed to push him out of the way in time, and he sustained minor rib and head injuries. Unfortunately, the <a href=#>celebrity’s</a> brave act meant she lost her life in the incident. She died almost instantly and suffered injuries to her head and chest.</p><p>Founder of the Comercial Mexicana supermarket chain Carlos González Nova owned the boat, though it was being driven by an employee of his, José Cen Yam. Yam was found guilty of culpable homicide and sentenced to nearly three years in prison.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Bradley Cooper’s daughter meets Lady Gaga as fans ‘cry’ at adorable moment</a></p><p>However, he later avoided prison by paying just £61. A campaign, Justice for Kirsty was created by her loved ones. They urged a judicial review of the incident because of the lack of cooperation by the Mexican government.</p><p>Carlos González Nova died in 2009 at the age of 92. The campaign was <a href=# rel=nofollow>dissolved</a>, and her family donated the remaining funds to charities which she would have “approved of,” said her loved ones.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-kirsty-changed-the-beloved-song-fairytale-of-new-york>How Kirsty changed the beloved song Fairytale of New York</h2><p>In a 2018 interview, Kirsty’s ex-husband, whom she shared her two children with, Steve Lillywhite spoke about the song Fairytale of New York. It has become a staple for this time of year, and was voted the nation’s favorite Christmas song in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent poll</a>.</p><p>Producer of the track, Steve, explained after hearing Kirsty’s vocals, <a href=#>Shane MacGowan</a> re-recorded the song. He felt that his original ones didn’t match up to what she had done.</p><p>“I said, ‘I’ve got my studio at home, so we don’t have to use the expensive studio that you guys are paying for. I’ll do it over the weekend and come in on Monday and you’ll hear her’,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explained</a></p><p>“I remember coming home with the tape on Saturday, and I spent the weekend working with her. It took that long because, to be honest, it’s a deceptively simple song to sing well. And the way Kirsty sang it, with her inflections, is very unique.</p><p>“Whenever I hear someone else sing the song now – they never get it the same way as Kirsty. We spent a long time getting every single note perfect. And we both knew, ‘We’ve got something here’.</p><p>“The Pogues were knocked out. Shane had thought he’d done his vocal right the first time, but it was obvious when he heard his against Kirsty’s that it just wasn’t up to scratch. So he re-did his vocal. The thing was – hearing her completely raised his game and changed the song.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shane-macgowan-recently-died-after-long-hospital-stay>Shane MacGowan recently died after long hospital stay</h2><p>23 years after Kirsty MacColl’s death, Shane, who was the lead singer of The Pogues, <a href=#>died in late November</a> after suffering from a long illness.</p><p>Sharing a black and white photo of the star to <a href=#>Instagram</a>, his wife Victoria paid tribute.</p><p>She wrote: “I don’t know how to say this so I am just going to say it. Shane who will always be the light that I hold before me and the measure of my dreams and the love [red heart emoji] of my life, and the most beautiful soul and beautiful angel and the sun and the moon and the start and end of everything that I hold dear has gone to be with Jesus and Mary and his beautiful mother Therese.</p><p>“I am blessed beyond words to have met him and to have loved him and to have been so endlessly and unconditionally loved by him and to have had so many years of life and love [red heart emoji] and joy and fun and laughter and so many adventures.”</p><p>Victoria signed off with: “Rave on in the garden all wet with rain that you loved so much [red heart emojis] You meant the world to me.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Andre Braugher’s final Instagram posts were a tribute to his Brooklyn Nine-Nine role</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aFcLLAoqmyrJGhsm67xWalnq9drryzt9JmoqKqo6nGbrnAnJqopJxisaqxw2aZsmWgp7y1scKtoKefXZ2ys3nSqKVmoZ5itbC%2B0aipZpmTmLalsc2tZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./caroline-wozniacki-poses-nude-espn-magazine-html.html><span>←</span><span>Caroline Wozniacki poses nude for ESPN The Magazine</span></a>
