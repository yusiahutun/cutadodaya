The original trek was scheduled to end in Oct. 7, but after missing several weeks due to vocal rest, many dates have been <a href=#>rescheduled</a> into next year. Ernest and Bailey Zimmerman are serving as direct support, with Hardy and Parker McCollum joining on select dates.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>See Inside Morgan Wallen's Recently Sold Nashville Home</h2><a href=#>Morgan Wallen</a> has sold his Nashville home for $835,000.
