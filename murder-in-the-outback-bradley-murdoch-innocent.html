The pair then drove into the Outback to execute their plan to fake Peters death for a monetary reward (insurance)." Others even called for a retrial, with one person writing: "Man deserves a retrial. There’s no way someone can watch this and 100% without a doubt think this is a fair conviction. Something stinks!"&nbsp;</p><p id=eUQ2-Hfn-Ok9 data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Kris Marshall reveals the real reason he quit Death in Paradise</a></strong></p><p id=etE5VEIdEaAy><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9389b8633a21-joanne-lees-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=ekklRygnUjVv data-wc=5><strong>Joanne Lees survived the incident</strong></p><p id=eTK2AH7vUh6O data-wc=71>However, others were convinced that the right man was in prison, with one writing: "Watched #murderintheoutback with interest, having covered some of Bradley Murdoch's murder trial as a journalist. Sorry to be boring but still convinced he killed Falconio." Bradley has appealed his conviction twice since being found guilty of Peter's murder in 2005, with one being rejected and the other cancelled. He has always denied his involvement in Peter's disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p id=exu5D77G6YqH data-wc=134>Viewers recently suggested that Peter might still be alive after a couple who worked at a service station near to the crime revealed that they were certain that they had seen him after his disappearance. Robert Brown explained: "I was reading the race results in the paper and I heard the door squeak, and Melissa was on the other side and she’s yelling out to me. She yelled at me again and then the next minute she turned the paper over and on the front page there was a picture of a gentleman down in the bottom right-hand corner and she tapped it. I put the paper down and walked around the corner and then bang I am looking straight at this bloke I saw in the paper. I was sort of in shock."&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
