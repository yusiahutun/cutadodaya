I certainly haven’t gone that long without sharing <i>any</i> cake recipes — I’m not a monster — but sometimes you need more than an <a href=#>Everyday Cake</a>. Sometimes you need <a href=#>a great big celebratory ta-da</a> in the center of your table. Sometime like now.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=640 height=427 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/03/baked-chickpeas-with-pita-chips-and-yogurt1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Nothing against <a href=#>barbecue-style baked beans</a>, all tangy sauced and full of smoky burnt end drippings — hi <a href=#>summer</a>, get here quick please — but I hardly see why navy beans get to have all of the fun. Where are the baked kidney beans, black-eyed peas and gigantes? Baking is a phenomenal way to cook dried beans and a great way to make something more complex of canned ones; when you start considering flavors, the sky, nay, the globe is the limit. I want <a href=#>these red beans</a> slow-baked in a big casserole, scooped with tortilla chips. I want baked black beans heaped over tostones, braised white beans over Catalan-style tomato bread and I want what we had for dinner last night for the first time all over again, because it was perfect.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=5616 height=3744 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/03/the-consolation-prize-a-pineapple-lime-coconut-and-mint-mocktail1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> In the almost six years since I last waddled around in the name of <a href=#>procreation</a> — I know, I make it sound so glowy and glamorous — to my delight, two things in particular have changed: 1. You can now get maternity pants that have almost all of the dignity of regular ones, thanks to small elastic panels above each pocket that frankly would be as welcome the day after Thanksgiving as they are now that I’m approaching the six-month mark and people no longer believe me when I said I just had a really big lunch. (However, a New York-specific rule remains: you’re not actually “big” until someone willingly cedes his or her seat on the subway for you, by which standards, I must be svelte. Hey, I’ll take it.) 2. More pertinently to the scope of a cooking website, a whole lot of bars are making <a href=#>really great mocktails</a>.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4903 height=3269 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/03/potatoes-with-soft-eggs-and-warm-bacon-vinaigrette1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I was going to offer today a kind of loose apology. “Sorry, guys, for all of the potatoes and eggs and utter randomness of recipes this winter,” and then shamelessly go onto blame this <a href=#>approaching third-trimester (ack, too soon) situation</a> with its still-unpredictable food cravings I’m in but then I realized: this is actually nothing new. There isn’t a recipe in the almost 9 years and 975-deep archives on this site that hasn’t been fueled wholly by hankerings, usually arbitrary ones. Some people have lesson plans and editorial calendars, I have whims. It’s just now I have a tiny thing — a future rock star, if the dance party from 2 to 6 a.m. last night is indication — to blame for it.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=4860 height=3240 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/03/black-bottom-oatmeal-pie1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Does anyone ever need an excuse to eat pie? Nobody we should be friends with, is my mantra. But, in an effort at inclusivity, here is a handy dandy excuse-finder, should you need a little convincing:<ul><li>Because it is not Friday yet.</li><li>Because you probably woke up before you wanted to, and went to a job that even if you love, is still by definition something you wouldn’t do for free. Pie is an excellent consolation prize.</li><li>Because yesterday felt like spring and everyone’s 3-month bad mood instantly evaporated. Today you needed a hat and gloves again. And a slice of pie, warmed just enough that a scoop of vanilla ice cream trickles over it.</li><li>Because you’re probably never going to win that <a href=#>Maine Inn</a> in time for lobster and blueberries season with an essay. (Although we are all rooting for you. And blueberry pie.)</li><li>Because if you’re in the Northeast, fresh fruit pies are still months off, which means you get to make pies with chocolate and gooey caramel instead.</li></ul><p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=5616 height=3744 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/03/green-grain-and-red-bean-taco-bowl1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I swear, this wholesome-looking meal isn’t penance for anything. It’s not a budget-friendly apology for the frenetic unplanned <a href=#>redecorating project</a> or atonement for the fact that I’ve basically only wanted to eat chocolate, peanut butter, bread and <a href=#>pasta</a> for the <a href=#>last 22 weeks</a>. It’s not compensation for the frosting that didn’t make it onto <a href=#>the cake</a> and was eaten instead with a spoon, or the impulsive <a href=#>meringues</a> last weekend. It’s only ever-so-quietly a warning that the next thing coming on this site is so decadent, you might wish to advance yourself some greens, grains and beans.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2048 height=1364 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/03/16531757598_bac3f9a735_k.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> I’m pretty sure I’m the last person in the cooking-obsessed world to get <a href=#>Sean Brock</a> Fever, the chef behind McCrady’s, Husk, and Minero in Charleston. Worse, this is probably a good time to admit that I was sent his first cookbook, <a href=#>Heritage</a>, when it came out and rejected it on sight alone. There was something about those sleeve tattoos cupping the sacred rainbow beans, an image I’ve seen variations on countless other farm-to-table cookbook covers and magazine spreads, that put me off. Skimming the recipes didn’t always help. Your red peas, cornmeal and gold rice should be from <a href=#>Anson Mills</a>, and if not, at least the cornmeal should be fresh from a gristmill. Your tomatoes should be home-canned, or at the very least, San Marzano. Your pork should be from a heritage pig, your buttermilk and goat cheese should come from a local farm, as should your Red Bliss potatoes; this is your <i>heritage</i> after all.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=5046 height=3364 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2015/02/the-i-want-chocolate-cake-cake1.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> About six weeks ago, around 9 p.m. on a day I had consumed mostly air and maybe a slice of toast because I couldn’t for the life of me <a href=#>imagine how food had ever tasted good</a>, without any warning, I wanted a slice of chocolate cake with swirls of chocolate frosting and probably some sprinkles and the sprinkles, so help them, better be rainbow. Except the word “wanted” doesn’t accurately describe the craving; it was suddenly <a href=#>everything</a>. I needed a piece of chocolate cake so badly that I began to regret every cupcake shop I’d ever walked past and not gone in during the height of the mid-aughts cupcake craze. I regretted not licking every beater of chocolate buttercream that had ever crossed my path when I worked at a bakery in high school. And I regretted that when I asked my husband why we didn’t have any chocolate cake, he said “because you haven’t made any?” He was correct — I’d made them dinner, instead — and the great unraveling of all that had once been right and good but failed to lead me to chocolate cake continued.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2560 height=1707 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/spaghetti-pangrattato-with-fried-eggs-8-scaled.jpg alt decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Several years ago, because we didn’t have a kid yet, didn’t know about things like school break schedules and figured midway through February was as good of a time to escape the snow as any, we decided to get away to someplace warm and winter-free during Presidents’ Day week. We found ourselves smack dab in the middle of a beach resort that had to have easily been 75% children, and the kind that were at that time my worst nightmare of what kids could be [insert yours here, then multiply it as far as you can see] and we decided to both never have kids and never ever go away on Presidents’ Week again.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirnZ7BtbHNpKCtm5iau2%2BvzqZmqZmXmnx1fo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lauren-alaina-new-music-vocal-cord-surgery.html><span>←</span><span>Lauren Alaina on Her First Album After Vocal Cord Surgery</span></a>
