As she gets to know her next-door neighbor, the Episcopal priest Father Tim (Cameron Mathison), the young boy he's been given guardianship over, and other members of the community and local church, Coppersmith finds the extended family that's been missing from her busy life.</p><img alt="Andie MacDowell red carpet for Hallmark Channel" title="Andie MacDowell on media tour for Hallmark Channel" width=1024 height=707 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/31/1501792153-gettyimages-823754180.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">MacDowell, who grew up in Gaffney, South Carolina, and spent summers in Arden, North Carolina (her family's former summer home is now a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vrbo.com/948158 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="charming historical inn" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">charming historical inn</a>), says there's "something sweet about living in a small town." That, and the fact that so many of her friends and family members had read and loved the Mitford books, attracted her to the project. She first approached producer Howard Braunstein, who originally optioned the rights from Jan Karon, several years ago while starring in the small-town drama Cedar Cove, also on Hallmark.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I wish I could find Father Tim.

"She's a mature woman who finally gets this opportunity to feel what it would be like to be a mother...provided to her through the situation, by moving in next door to Father Tim and having this young child come into her life."</p><img alt="Lighting, Room, Interior design, Furniture, Interior design, Home, Refrigerator, Kitchen appliance, Countertop, Cabinetry, " title="Lighting, Room, Interior design, Furniture, Interior design, Home, Refrigerator, Kitchen appliance, Countertop, Cabinetry, " width=726 height=410 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/31/1501793752-andiemacdowell-athomeinmitford-desk.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Courtesy of Hallmark Channel</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Playing Cynthia wasn't a too far of a stretch for MacDowell, who is twice divorced and living in southern California with her Boston Terrier/Chihuahua mix Ava, whom she adopted from the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://langefoundation.org/dogs/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lange Foundation" class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">Lange Foundation</a>.

Cynthia isn't much of a churchgoer at first, but as her connections in Mitford deepens, she learns "how deeply she could be fed by that atmosphere," says MacDowell. "We are all in need of belonging and having healthy connections and a place where we feel safe."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">Hallmark Channel's At Home in Mitford airs Sunday, Aug. 20 at 10/9 central.</p><h6 class="css-5zz7ok e6pr2lz3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e6pr2lz1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursZyew6q6xmeaqKVfobansY6epa2doqmuqrrMnqWtZ5FpgXN%2BlGiYrWWYpLqmecinZKahpJu8s7CMoZilpJ2Wv6x5wqGYp6aVoXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./these-2017-tom-brady-deflategate-memes-are-all-kinds-of-hilarious-35736.html><span>←</span><span>These 2017 Tom Brady &amp;quot;Deflategate&amp;quot; Memes Are All Kinds Of Hilarious</span></a>
