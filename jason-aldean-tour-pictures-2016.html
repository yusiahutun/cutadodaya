Of course the highlight was their hit "Smoke," but the group also delivered a countrified cover of "Hard to Handle."</p><p>Then, it was time for Thomas&nbsp;Rhett to shake things up with his dance moves and slew of hits. "South Side" was a crowd favorite in Atlantic City — when Rhett requested that everyone shake their 'south side,' they delivered. It was the perfect warmup for what was to come: the headliner.</p><p>By the time Aldean's boots hit the stage, the&nbsp;crowd was fired up. He quickly launched into&nbsp;"Just Gettin' Started" before playing&nbsp;&nbsp;“Gonna Know We Were Here” and "Big Green Tractor." And when&nbsp;you have as many hits as Aldean does, sometimes you have to play a medley. He did that with several of his songs, sharing with fans&nbsp;that he was thankful, because New Jersey helped to make them popular. Aldean invited Rhett back on stage for a duet of "1994," which TR wrote.</p><p>Click through the gallery above to see highlights from the 2016 We Were Here Tour in New Jersey!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5mjpLturcudnJqmXam8tr6MqaCcrKWnsrR5kWlob2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ray-charles-eddie-bayers-pete-drake-and-the-judds-to-be-inducted-into-the-country-music-hall-of-fame.html><span>←</span><span>Ray Charles, Eddie Bayers, Pete Drake, And The Judds To Be Inducted Into The Country Music Hall of F</span></a>
