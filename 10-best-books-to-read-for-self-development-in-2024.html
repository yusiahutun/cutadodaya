But sometimes a good read leaves a mark and lets us learn and grow from within. It can be a fictional story of a person with whom we can resemble our traits or a non-fiction factual piece of information that deals with reality.

The people who gain acceptance of themselves don’t blame anyone or themselves for their misfortune, instead, they ask themselves: why did it happen? to learn from their mistakes. Self-development takes place naturally throughout life, but sometimes we learn from other individuals and reflect on their learnings in our life context.
