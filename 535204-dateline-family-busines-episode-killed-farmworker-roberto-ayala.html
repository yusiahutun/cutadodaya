The explosion resulted in the painful death of farm manager Robert Ayala. The synopsis reads:</p>Investigating whether an explosion in a rice field in Colusa County, California that killed farm manager Roberto Ayala is an accident or murder.<h2>Who was Roberto Ayala?</h2><p class=align-left>Roberto was a farm manager at the Moore Brother Farms. He became a murder victim at the rice farm. Roberto is survived by his wife, Fabiola, his sons, Jesus and Fabian, and his daughter, Paula.</p><p class=align-left>Since Roberto's death, his brother, Eduardo Ayala, assumed most of his brother's responsibilities at the Moore Rice Farm.</p><h2>Colusa California murders</h2><p class=align-left>On 16th July 2011, Robert Ayala drove to one of the Moore brothers’ rice fields in Colusa County, California, to fix an irrigation pump. He was in the company of his then seven-year-old son, Fabian Ayala, whom he had picked up and bought lunch for before heading to the farm.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8b7b214992b989db.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rita Waeni, 6 Other Heart-Wrenching Murder Cases that Have Captured Kenya's Attention in January</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A few moments later, Ayala's son heard a massive explosion, only to spot his father on fire. In a panic, he ran for around two miles through the farm, seeking help to no avail.</p><p class=align-left>When the firefighters arrived at the scene, Roberto's body was still ablaze. The metal pieces badly punctured his neck, chest, and brain. Before suffering from the fire-related injuries, he had sustained fragmented injuries and piercing shrapnel.</p><p class=align-left>What did Robert Ayala die of? From the autopsy report, the farm worker died of explosive shrapnel injuries and high-voltage electric shock. Initially, neither law enforcement nor the fire department knew that a bomb was intentionally hidden in the pump.</p><h2>Moore’s family’s internal conflict</h2><p class=align-left>Robert’s death occurred while he was embroiled in the family’s internal conflict between Paul and Peter Moore. Paul and Peter, the two primary players, were cousins. Their dads were the sons of Richard and Mimi Moore, who owned the 1800-acre property near Colusa.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1c50a3f0dcc7c3de.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Starlet Wahu, Rita Waeni and Other 4 Women who Died in Pursuit of Love, Passion</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Peter and Paul were unhappy with their standing on the farm, hence the feud. For instance, Peter Moore didn't have permission to farm and earned a living in the landscape sector for over two decades. He often threatened to harm people like his uncle, dad, and Roberto.</p><p class=align-left>Paul Moore believed that growing up, he was mistreated, unlike some employees such as Roberto and his brother Eduardo. He believed that even though he worked harder, he was treated badly and never offered a raise.</p><p class=align-left>Apart from the feud between Peter and Paul Moore against each other, the two shared a hatred towards the farmworker.</p><h2>Letters implicating Paul Moore</h2><p class=align-left>While the investigations were still underway, the authorities <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">received letters implicating Paul </a>in the explosion and Roberto’s death. In the two anonymous letters, the sender claimed responsibility for killing the farmworker. The second letter had a diagram of the bomb used at the rice field.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/09095de4edd376f2.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ceasar Handa: Renowned Ex-Gor Mahia Player and Sports Enthusiast Is Dead</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The law enforcers and investigators kept searching for potential suspects, but as they progressed, all the evidence found kept leading them to Paul Moore. In December 2021, a search was conducted in Paul's home, only to discover some incriminating evidence on his devices.</p><p class=align-left>The authorities found the stamps used in the letters and a similar diagram matching the one in the second letter sent to the police. They also found evidence connecting Paul to the letters and the items at the crime scene.</p><h2>Who killed farmworker Roberto Ayala?</h2><p class=align-left>Paul Moore is responsible for the death of Roberto Ayala. In a 2013 trial, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Paul was found guilty</a> and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

In 2016, the Court of Appeal <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">upheld the conviction</a>. The appeal court stated:</p>Paul was afforded a fair trial. His trial lawyer provided excellent representation and advocacy. But 12 jurors of Paul’s peers found that the circumstantial evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he murdered Roberto Ayala, and we must respect their verdict.<h2>Roberto Ayala’s family compensation</h2><p class=align-left>In December 2016, a Colusa County judge approved a <a id=https://www.appeal-democrat.com/colusa_sun_herald/bomb-victim-s-family-awarded-20m/article_c1ef99da-bc30-11e6-ac6a-2fbb44836d41.html href=# rel="nofollow noopener">wrongful death lawsuit</a> filed in 2013 by the Ayalas against the Moore Brothers Arlan, Paul, and Roger Moore.
