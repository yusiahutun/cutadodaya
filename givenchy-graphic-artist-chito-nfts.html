Williams, joined the house in the summer of 2020, he was determined to bring to his designs his flair for artistic innovation. His latest collaboration has done just that.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Partnering with graphic artist Chito, with whom he already worked on the spring 2022 pre-collection, Williams has co-created a series of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://nft.givenchy.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="15 unique graphic designs" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">15 unique graphic designs</a>. The collection will feature the same bold prints used in the spring pre-collection, building on the air-brushed characters and symbols. The difference is, these rare images will be NFTs.</p><img alt="givenchy nft chito" title="givenchy nft chito" width=2000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/givenchy-pitty-bloody-1638782682.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One of the the online world's most popular rising trends, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), like the Givenchy x Chito designs, are unique digital pieces that can be used by collectors as online avatars or PFPs (profile pictures). These can be anything from audio clips and videos to assets within online games, which can be bought with cryptocurrency like bitcoin. Though anyone can view them, only one person will 'own' the original - much like owning a poster of a Van Gogh, but not the original oil painting. Understandably, the fastest growth area for NFTs is in the art world, where these online images and files are quickly becoming exciting collector pieces, raising the profile and value of digital artwork.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The fashion world is also increasingly adopting NFTs, realising the significance of a digital landscape as well as the power it gives creatives. For artists like Chito, the NFT movement allows them to work directly with their audience - and on a truly global scale. In an effort to remain <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/g19491797/the-best-and-still-chic-sustainable-brands/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=eco-conscious class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">eco-conscious</a>, and off-set any carbon footprint or energy costs, Givenchy has also decided to launch the NFT collection on the Polygon network, known for its minimal energy consumption.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I’ve been wanting to explore this new and exciting space of NFTs," says Williams. "The fact that Chito is already active in the ecosystem made it feel even more natural for us to collaborate on this limited series and bring our collective vision for Givenchy even further.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The original set of artworks went on sale on 23 November and the auction will help support Givenchy’s long-term preferred foundation, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://theoceancleanup.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Ocean Cleanup" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Ocean Cleanup</a>. Though this 15-piece series will be a rare acquisition, Givenchy has announced that it is merely their first dip into the ever-expanding world of NFTs.
