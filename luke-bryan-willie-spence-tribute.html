His stunning death came just hours after he reminded his half-million followers on social media why he was so dynamic. A<a href=#> video performance</a> from a vehicle of a worship song proved to be his final notes for fans.</p><p>"Willie really did light up every room he walked into," Bryan writes, quote-tweeting the official American Idol Twitter account's message about Spence's death. "He will be truly missed."</p><p>Other stars from Season 19 of American Idol also took to social media to remember Spence.</p><p>Judge Lionel Richie shared Spence's performance of <a href=#>Adele</a>'s "Set Fire&nbsp;to the Rain" from 2021 and captioned with a few personal words:</p><p>"Your light will always shine in this world," the veteran star says. "We were so blessed to get a chance to see you shine. My thoughts and prayers are with Willie's family. Rest well my friend."</p><p>Season 19 winner <a href=#>Chayce Beckham</a> <a href=#>also remembers Spence</a> fondly,&nbsp;gushing about his larger-than-life personality, honest sense of humor and voice that could shake a room and bring you to tears.</p><p>The gospel performance of "You Are My Hiding Place" has become a place to tribute Spence, a fan-favorite from 2021. He auditioned with Rihanna's "Diamonds," a song he had casually performed in a church circle some time before his fame. This video remains pinned to his Instagram page.</p><p>Judge Katy Perry offered a sympathetic word in the official <a href=#>American Idol Instagram</a> announcement of Spence's death, while host Ryan Seacrest shared his thoughts on Instagram Story.</p><p>Since finishing second on American Idol, the singer had remained busy and was very much looking forward to a show in London, planned for November.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>R.I.P.: 27 Country Singers and Songwriters Who Died Too Soon</h2><p>These country singers had so much more to give.
