No lady would let him post this!!" one fan wrote, for example.</p><p>That seems to be a bit of wild speculation, but there has been a great deal of recent chatter over <a href=#>the way The Bachelor is about to end</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“I don’t think anyone expected my journey to end the way that it did, including myself, nor did I want it to be that way," Echard said on the Women Tell All episode this week, teasing whatever is about to transpire as follows:</p><p>"Everyone will be kind of surprised.</p><p>"I wish it could have went any other direction, but it went the direction that it did."</p><p>Cue the creepy music!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Speaking to Us Weekly after this special wrapped up, <a href=#>Echard was clearly shaken up</a>.</p><p>“I do wear my emotions on my sleeve, especially with facial expressions,” the 28-year-old told this tabloid backstage at the taping, adding of how he felt while his suitors sort of went off on him:</p><p>“A few of the women come up afterward and [to] tell me, ‘Hey, smile.’</p><p>"I think it’s pretty apparent that I was a little rattled by this. It really hurts me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src>Watch The Bachelor Season 26 Episode 0 Online<p>Clayton emphasized that he’s “always been a people pleaser,” which made it challenging to take on the role of The Bachelor.</p><p>“I’ve always tried to keep as many people happy as I interact with.</p><p>"And tonight showed me that I really frustrated a lot of these women, and I hope that they can forgive me, ultimately,” he continued.</p><p>“But I could only say what I felt was needed to be said. I hope they understand that I’m human. And I tried my best.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The most prominent voice on the special belonged to Season 26 villain&nbsp;<a href=#>Shanae Ankney</a>.</p><p>“I don’t like to hold onto anything. I am willing to forgive everyone for their actions. I was shocked by Shanae,” Clayton confessed to Us about watching the show.</p><p>“I think she showed me one thing and did another on camera, but you know what?</p><p>"I think everybody deserves some grace and I certainly hope that if she feels apologetic for what she did, then I can forgive her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In general, the former football player said he wishes he could have some do-overs.</p><p>“I should have asked more questions. I don’t necessarily know what in particular I could have done specifically,” he said.</p><p>“I mean, our days, we were running around doing a million things. It’s not like we had downtime, but I could have in those moments just asked another question or two.</p><p>"And that may have uncovered what I needed to uncover.”</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2WAcK%2FLmrCtp55isqS0wKubZquYlr%2Bmv4ycqbKopJ6wbrXNrKuan6KWum68x6irqGWZqHqktM6comaepaG5brvFZplo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./audiences-returning-to-some-city-winery-locations-in-october.html><span>←</span><span>Audiences Returning To Some City Winery Locations In October</span></a>
