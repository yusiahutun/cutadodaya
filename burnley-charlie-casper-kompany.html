Highly-rated Casper is the grandson of former Turf Moor boss Frank and steeped in Clarets tradition, with his rise catching the eye.
Casper may go out on loan this season to keep up his rapid improvement.
The youngster is yet to feature in a matchday squad but Vincent Kompany did bring him along on the short trip to Preston last month."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
