And while he was there, the star also asked an ER doctor about the knot on his right shin. Since the knot was roughly the size of a grape, the doctor told him it was likely nothing but to keep an eye on it.</span></p><p><span>By next month the knot had grown to the size of a golf ball, and he was immediately referred to a general surgeon. Furthermore, when the turn for his examination arrived, the knot was even bigger with two additional knots beside it.</span></p><p><span>And when the knot finally grew to the size of a tennis ball and was “busting through the skin and bleeding,” the doctors knew they needed to perform a biopsy.</span></p><p><span>10 days after the biopsy, Travis was informed that he had fibrosarcoma, a rare form of extremely fast-growing malignant cancer. In addition, it was so larger and intertwined that it was impossible to remove all of cancer by removing the tumors.</span></p><p><span>Thus, he was prompted to amputate his leg.</span></p><p><span>The surgery then took place on the first week of Feb 2022, and by the second week, Travis was on the recovery road. “Just a quick update. The surgery went well. My leg stump is sore. But still in great spirits and feel good other than that,” Travis updated his fans on Feb 9, via FB post.</span></p><h3><b>Travis “T-Bone” Turner Weight Today</b></h3><p><span>Travis “T-Bone” Turner was reportedly over 136 kg (300 lbs) as of 2022. However, after the leg amputation surgery, he must have lost a certain amount of weight.</span></p><p><span>If you don’t know, this isn’t Travis’s first surgery. Back in late 2004, he underwent stomach bypass surgery, after which his weight steadily declined from 247 kg (544 lbs) to 227 kg (501lbs) on Oct. 20, and down to 172 kg (379 lbs) on April 30, 2005.</span></p><h3><b>Who Is Travis “T-Bone” Turner Wife?</b></h3><p><span>Travis “T-Bone” Turner’s wife Michelle Turner is a teacher who reportedly worked at </span><i><span>Coweta County School</span></i><span> in Coweta County, Georgia.</span></p><p><span>The two were married back on December 23, 2003, after dating for over 2 and a half years.

My ride or die, a partner in crime, baby mama. Main squeeze, better half, anchor of the homestead.”</span></p><p><span>Talking about their kids, Travis and Michelle welcomed their son named Archer on September 28, 2005.

And with the win, he was able to make long-standing relationships with companies such as Realtree, Hoyt, Bone Collector, and Whitetails Unlimited.</span></p><p><span>The guy then went on to work as a bow technician for national celebrities and pro athletes. Finally, in 2008, he received an invitation from Michael Waddell to join his dream team of </span><i><span>Bone Collector</span></i><span> and got shot to the international limelight.</span></p><p><span>Besides these, Travis also was working as a spokesman for </span><i><span>Whitetails Unlimited</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>To mention his qualifications, Travis is an ASA and APA certified professional archer who is a 4-time Georgia State Cham.

His dad was a fireman in Dayton, but the family then had to move to Atlanta when he was transferred. And that was where Travis learned how to hunt.</span></p><p><span>Out of all the people that influenced him, Travis said that his dad was his number one icon. “He took me squirrel hunting and fishing when I was 4 or 5 years old.
