  There are a hundred and one ways to bookmark your favourite websites, whether it's using your browser's native bookmarking system or using an online service like Delicious or Google Bookmarks, each of which has its pros and cons.
One con is that after a while, your bookmarks can become hard to manage. Using a visual bookmarking website as your homepage is the best way to access favorites at hand for quick and easy access."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Using a visual bookmarking website as your homepage is the best way to access favorites at hand for quick and easy access.</p><p>Each of these services have their own unique added features, including RSS feeds, inbuilt search, tabs, groups, and bookmarklets for easily adding new bookmarks.</p><p></p><h3 id=favetop><strong>Favetop</strong></h3><p>Favetop serves as a desktop for your favourite links, websites and media online. Using the website as your homepage would give you quick access to sites that you visit frequently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can quickly populate your Favetop favourite websites with the recommended sites which include Bing, Google, Twitter, Amazon and Facebook, amongst many others. Going into the settings allows you to delete the sites you would prefer not to add to your front page. Alternatively, you can choose to manually enter each of the websites yourself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Favetop2.png><p>Other than your favourite websites, you can also add your favourite online videos, photos, music, games and bookmarks to specific blog posts, articles and so forth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/FaveTop2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You don't actually have to sign up for an account to be able to add content to Favetop, but the same doesn't go for deleting. If you want to be able to remove content from your page, you will have to sign up for a free account.</p><p>You can also use Favetop to perform searches, choosing between Google, Yahoo and Bing as your search engine.</p><h3 id=getwapps><strong>Getwapps</strong></h3><p>After signing up and activating your account, you're ready to start setting up your own personal customised page on Getwapps.</p><p>Using their setup wizard, you can select a few of your favourite websites or services, give the list a name, and then choose whether or not turn on your Meebo Bar to chat with friends using Facebook Chat, GTalk, AIM, MSN etc.</p><p>Getwapps' default homepage features a variety of websites they have chosen for you including Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, amongst others. The appearance is highly customisable, allowing you to change the title, and the image associated with the site, with the added ability of instantly taking a screenshot from the site without ever leaving your Getwapps page.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/GetWapps2.png><p>Getwapps' main aim is to keep you organized with the ability to create as many lists as you want, featuring large buttons for each site. It also has a mini list in the right hand sidebar. One of Getwapps' interesting features is the fact that you can search sites directly from within the button that appears on your homepage. If you want to be able to search Amazon, for instance, from within Getwapps, be sure to add Amazon using the Wapps Store.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/GetWapps.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another similar website to Getwapps that deserves a mention is <a href=#>Only2Clicks</a>. It has a very similar interface to Getwapps with the added bonus of tabbed pages, an <span class=removed_link>iPhone interface</span>, and a variety of skins to change the appearance of the entire page.</p><h3 id=start-io><a href=#><strong>Start.io</strong></a></h3><p>Start.io takes a minimalist approach, which will appeal to people who prefer a simple and uncluttered start page. You can create as many groups as you like, and add websites to those groups. Start.io also has an import feature, allowing you to import your bookmarks if you would prefer to use it as a starting point for all of the sites that you use, rather than just your favourites. Your links appear as a series of categorised lists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/start.io_.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once you've got your links set up, you can choose whether or not to make your start page public or private, whether or not to open links in a new page, and to customize your background.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/start.io-links.png><p>Start.io has a bookmarklet making it easy to add new websites to your Start.io webpage from the comfort of your bookmark bar.</p><p>A coloured bullet point will appear next to any page which features new updates since you last visited it.</p><h3 id=43marks><a href=#><strong>43Marks</strong></a></h3><p>43Marks sets itself apart from the rest of this list by allowing you to add not only your favourite bookmarks, but also allows you to add your favourite RSS feeds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/43Marks.png><p>Default bookmarks are added for you, which you can remove, as well as the categories themselves, including Email, Social, Photo, Movies and more. The appearance can also be customised by rearranging categories, changing the colours of each category, and the RSS feeds can be displayed as expanded or collapsed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/43Marks-RSS.png><p>From your 43Marks homepage, you can search Google, Bing, Yahoo and Wikipedia, and can choose whether or not to share your 43Marks page publicly or keep it private.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Do you have a special system for accessing your favourite websites?
