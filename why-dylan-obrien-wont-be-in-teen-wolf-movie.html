A lot went into it," he told Variety's Marc Malkin. "The show couldn't be more dear to me. It was the first thing I ever did I and so many people there are extremely dear to me."</p><p>"It was something I was trying to make work but it all happened very fast," he continued. "We didn't really know that it was happening and they kind of just threw it at us a little bit, which is fine because we all love the show. We were trying to figure it out."</p><p>Despite this, the "Maze Runner" star said he decided to pass on the project due to how his character's story was concluded.</p><p>"Ultimately, I just decided it was left in a really good place for me and I still want to leave it there," O'Brien said, before sharing his support for the film and his former castmates. "I wish them well and I'm going to watch it the first night it comes out. I hope it f---ing kicks ass, but I'm not going to be in it."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:247870c6-d496-4f54-a3db-f784280a1c2b data-container-ref=toofab:article:2728bf7a-e19a-4c0d-b27b-49c482943cbd data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/67/5by4/2021/06/08/67c39ed8cb7f4fbdb09e39192505c3f9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Alamy</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Teen Wolf Creator Reveals Big Names Who Auditioned But Never Made Main Cast</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Teen Wolf" premiered on June 2011 on MTV.

The wolves are howling once again, calling for the return of Banshees, Werecoyotes, Hellhounds, Kitsunes, and every other shapeshifter in the night. But only a Werewolf like Scott McCall, no longer a teenager yet still an Alpha, can gather both new allies and reunite trusted friends to fight back against what could be the most powerful and deadliest enemy they've ever faced."</p><p>Last month, Paramount+ revealed the list of series regulars who will be returning for the film.
