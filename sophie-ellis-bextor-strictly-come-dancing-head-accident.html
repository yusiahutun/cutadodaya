"I can do it, and I have actually really enjoyed putting the choreography together."</p><p id=enN8VoKUnz data-wc=32>One of the tricks in particular, I lay back and flip Sophie over my head, and unfortunately in rehearsals she actually landed on her head - first fear was, 'Are you alright?'</p><p id=eksJBP_gaY data-wc=24>"It is a very ambitious routine, I don't believe in doing the minimum but the maximum. I say push her and see what happens."</p><p id=eavbz1oBcU data-wc=42>Despite her unexpected tumble, Sophie has bounced back. Earlier in the week, she told fans, "Bumped my head training yesterday. I just checked - still know the raps in and so all vital cells in tact."</p><p id=e1QYt-PybBN data-wc=28>Later that same day, the mum-of-three tweeted, "Just danced our new routine at home.
