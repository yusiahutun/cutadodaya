"I was made to lay and rot," one TikTok user said of the practice "Bed rot" has gone viral.
While TikTok's latest self-care trend may have a repulsive-sounding name, "bed rotting" simply means laying in bed for lengthy periods of time -- something many a teenager across generations is familiar with.
Gen Z, of course, has taken it to a new level and branded "rotting" away in bed as a form of self-therapy -- and hundreds of millions of people are taking an interest in the practice.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Clements Twins Help Dad Find Life-Saving Transplant</h2><time>May 11, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../is-there-n-equivalent-in-vbscript.html></a>
I want to use the Replace function in VBScript to replace all line breaks in a string for "\n". I come from Java, so using \n inside a string means a line break.
Is there an equivalent in VBScript?
3 6 Answers For replace you can use vbCrLf:
Replace(string, vbCrLf, "") You can also use chr(13)+chr(10).
I seem to remember in some odd cases that chr(10) comes before chr(13).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>la firma britnica que ha conquistado Instagram</h2><time>May 11, 2024</time>
