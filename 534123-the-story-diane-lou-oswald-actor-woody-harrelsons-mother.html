Here are details about Diane Oswald:</p><h3>1. Her ex-husband was a contract killer</h3><p class=align-left>In 1959, Diane married Charles Harrelson. Charles worked as an encyclopaedia salesman in California and was a professional gambler. The couple welcomed three children until 1964 when he left his matrimonial home. During their marriage, Harrelson got involved in crime.</p><p class=align-left>In 1960, he was convicted of armed robbery. He later admitted that he had been involved in dozens of murders beginning in the early 1960s. In subsequent years, Diane's ex-husband <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">became a contract killer</a>. In 1968, Charles was tried for the 1968 murder of Alan Harry Berg. Fortunately, a jury in Angleton acquitted him on 22 September 1970.</p><p class=align-left>In 1968, a court tried Charles Harrelson for the 1968 murder-for-hire killing of Sam Degelia Jr., a resident of Hearne, Texas. Harrelson received $2,000 for the murder of Degelia, a grain dealer and father of four killed in McAllen, Texas. His first trial ended with a deadlocked jury.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7bfc8e117760e365.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Anne de Zogheb cause of death: The untold story of Paul Anka's ex-wife</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6b6eea48bd584caf.png><p class=align-left>The court found him guilty of being an accomplice to the murder and sentenced him to seven years probation. But the same court retried Harrelson in 1973, convicted him, and sentenced him to 15 years. The <a href=#>American convict </a>was later released from prison in 1978 for good behaviour.</p><p class=align-left>After his release from prison, the police implicated Harrelson and his then-wife, Jo Ann, in another murder of US district judge John H. Wood Jr. The court later convicted him of killing Judge Wood because a drug dealer had hired him. It then sentenced him to two life terms.</p><p class=align-left>In 2003, a witness to the murder claimed that Harrelson never shot the judge. Then, in September 1980, Charles surrendered to police after a six-hour standoff in which he was reportedly high on coke. During the standoff, he threatened to state that he had killed Judge Wood and President John F. Kennedy. However, he later recanted the story.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e2fabb17ece3edd4.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Andrew Schulz's wife, Emma Turner who is a stand-up comedian</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 1995, Charles Harrelson attempted to escape from prison. Guards at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary fired a warning shot that forced him and others to surrender. Unfortunately, Charles Harrelson<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> died on 15 March 2007 </a>at 68. His cause of death was a heart attack. Harrelson had had cancer in previous years.</p><h3>2.

She raised her children alone</h3><p class=align-left>Diane separated from her husband, Charles Harrelson, in 1964. The two were only married for five years. According to Woody Harrelson, his father disappeared from the family's home in Houston in 1968.</p><p class=align-left>As a result, he left his mother to raise him and his two siblings. They lost track of him until 1981, when Charles was arrested and later convicted of the murder of Judge Wood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7bfc8e117760e365.png><p class=align-left>Even after several convictions, Diane Lou never turned his children against their father. Woody admits that he visited his father regularly in <a href=#>federal prison </a>despite harbouring mixed feelings about him.</p><h3>4. Diane Lou is not related to Lee Harvey Oswald</h3><p class=align-left>At the time the authorities were arresting Charles Harrelson for killing Judge Wood, Harrelson admitted he had assassinated the 39th President of the USA, John F. Kennedy. However, the person who <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">assassinated the president</a> was Lee Harvey Oswald, a US Marine veteran.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a2589b24885da1ec.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Adrienne Calhoun and George Foreman's story: What really happened?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Is Diane Oswald related to Lee Harvey Oswald?
