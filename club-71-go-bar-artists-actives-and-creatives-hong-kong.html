I believe that taking preventive measures is enough. My team has been so serious about the measures – taking people’s temperatures and making people wash their hands – and I feel so safe when I’m in there,” Ma said.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The Wanch, oldest live-music venue in Hong Kong, shuts in Wan Chai</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For more than three decades Club 71 and its predecessor, Club 64, served as something of a salon where the city’s dissidents and left-leaning intellectual crowd could gather to discuss everything from politics to art over some of the most affordable drinks in the notoriously expensive district.</p>It was in late 1990 that Club 64 – named for the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Tiananmen crackdown on June 4</span></a>, 1989 – opened at the top of Wing Wah Lane in Lan Kwai Fong. Political activists such as future Legislative Councillor “Long Hair” Leung Kwok-hung and filmmakers including Christopher Doyle and Herman Yau Lai-to could often be found propping up the bar, and its grungy aesthetic provided a refreshing alternative to the glitzy bars and clubs found elsewhere in the area.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Michael Hutchence, the late frontman of rock band INXS who spent much of his childhood in Hong Kong, filmed part of his 1997 video series Rough Guide to Hong Kong in Club 64.</p>Because of its association with the pro-democracy movement and the Tiananmen crackdown, concerns were raised about the future of the bar ahead of the 1997 handover, but Club 64 powered on in <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Lan Kwai Fong</span></a> until 2004, when it was forced out by its landlord because of a rent increase.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The following year, Ma and her silent partner moved the venue a few hundred metres up the hill to SoHo and renamed it Club 71, with the name inspired by the massive protests on July 1, 2003, against proposed national security legislation to comply with Article 23 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution under Chinese rule.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Club 71 is on Hollywood Road, near “where Chinese revolutionaries once plotted the overthrow of the Qing dynasty”, the bar states on its Facebook page. It maintained the same bohemian atmosphere as Club 64, and engaged the community by hosting art exhibitions, meetings by gay rights groups, among others, and jam sessions with local musicians.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/29/cbd66474-0132-11eb-88c7-25dcd0ae6080_972x_182855.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even though her venues were often included on lists of the city’s best bars, Ma remains modest about the accomplishments of Clubs 64 and 71.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wouldn’t say we were important to that many people. We were just a tiny bar catering to a small circle of different people from different walks of life. Whoever came to the bar – people like artists and creatives – will have fond memories. I won’t deny that the venues had a position in the history of Hong Kong, but I don’t think we were overly important to most people in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The bar was only important because of the people who came. My regulars all had their own character or personality and everyone – even people who may have been less educated than others – felt at ease there. For example, we would have a professor mixing with artists, musicians and so on. The bar was all about the characters and this is the kind of culture I hope can continue developing here in the years to come.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/09/29/5120b09a-0132-11eb-88c7-25dcd0ae6080_972x_182855.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While coronavirus restrictions are gradually being relaxed, bar and club owners citywide have been hit hard financially by a loss of revenue this year, which has come on top of the disruptions to business caused by the anti-government protests in 2019.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most notably, The Wanch, the oldest live-music venue in Hong Kong, announced at the end of August it had vacated its premises in Wan Chai and would be suspending operations because of the loss of business caused by the shutdowns.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Pandemic claims a Hong Kong drinking institution</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLKvwMSrq5qhnqKyr8COmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkGlqbmhpZLCtwcFmbmpll6R6o63RZpirrJmowbR5wJyroq6VqHqiusNmmqudkam2t7HSZp%2BoppdiuLC6xg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./270337-best-building-construction-companies-nairobi-kenya-html.html><span>←</span><span>Best building construction companies in Nairobi Kenya</span></a>
