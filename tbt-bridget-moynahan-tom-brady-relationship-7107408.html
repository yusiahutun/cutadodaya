A few months after their split, the former model announced that she was pregnant — and that her ex was the father. While Brady was in the early stages of his relationship with his now&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ex-wife Gisele Bündchen</a>, he was committed to being a dad to his and Moynahan's child.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-august-22-2007-bridget-moynahan-and-tom-brady-welcome-their-first-child></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>August 22, 2007: Bridget Moynahan and Tom Brady welcome their first child</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On August 22, 2007, the former couple welcomed a baby boy, John "Jack" Edward Thomas, in Los Angeles. Apparently, Brady didn't want to miss out on the action, having reportedly taken a private jet to be with Moynahan for the birth,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>according to&nbsp;People</a>. Despite having called off their romantic relationship the year prior, the exes seemed set on cultivating a new relationship, namely, one of co-parenting.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-june-4-2008-bridget-moynahan-discusses-her-split-from-tom-brady></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>June 4, 2008: Bridget Moynahan discusses her split from Tom Brady</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Less than a year after her son's arrival, the&nbsp;Crown Vic&nbsp;star spoke about the "traumatic" experience of being pregnant while still getting over her breakup with Brady.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Going through that traumatic time of being heartbroken and then being pregnant turned my whole life upside down and inside out and just knocked the wind out of me," Moynahan&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told&nbsp;Harper's Bazaar</a>&nbsp;in 2008.
