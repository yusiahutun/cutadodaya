They sat on my dresser while I spent weeks gathering the will to wake up and head to a Pilates class in the cold, dark winter mornings before work. Finally, one groggy morning in December, I woke up, groaned, got dressed, and left for my workout wearing my new leggings, and thus began a budding romance.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Beyond Yoga Spacedye At Your Leisure High Waisted Midi Legging</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $99; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="afftrack=${DOC_ID}-${REQUEST_ID}">beyondyoga.com</a> and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These are incredibly comfortable leggings through and through. I have not consciously had to adjust the bottoms during my workouts — no pulling up of the waistband or stretching the fabric on my thighs. They also seem unperturbed by the obscene amounts of sweat my body expels. Most surprisingly, when I get home from my workout, I don't rip the Spacedye leggings off as fast as humanly possible. They are so comfortable and soft that I forget I'm wearing them, hours later I'll realize I haven't changed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are a few variations of the Spacedye leggings, but I have specifically taken to the high-waisted midi pair — they are so soft, they smooth out and conceal bumps and cellulite, and the v-shaped waistband is incredibly flattering for my XL curvy shape. According to a representative of the brand, Spacedye reigns supreme in popularity with celebrities like J.Lo, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Kendall Jenner</a>, Jenna Dewan, Lucy Hale, and many more. These celebs specifically opt for the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="afftrack=${DOC_ID}-${REQUEST_ID}">Spacedye Caught In The Midi High Waisted Legging</a>, which has a straight-across waistband.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The comfort of the Spacedye leggings has lulled me into such a state of bliss that I now wear them for non-workout purposes — to go grocery shopping, to go to the library, to sit in the park, to go to the coffee shop. For the first time in 14 years, I am wearing pants outside of a workout.
