Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds also attended Swift’s iconic “Taymerica” Fourth of July party in 2016.</p>The two still seem to be close. During the 2021 Grammys, Swift thanked <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Lively, Reynolds and their three kids</span></a> in her speech after she won album of the year for Folklore.

Eventually, the two singers met up (at Shake Shack) and formed a friendship. In fact, Swift told PopCrush that Lorde was one of the first people to hear 1989 before it was released, because Swift said the young singer gives awesome advice. Lorde also performed as one of Swift’s guest stars during her Washington DC 1989 tour performance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/24/7eaecdcd-1c17-4ea8-ae8a-7b1ba73fc179_eacb2dd4.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2017, after a publication mistakenly reported that she and Swift were on the outs, Lorde posted on X (formerly Twitter): “I want to say one more time that Taylor has been there for me in all my dark and light moments these past five years. All of them.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since then, however, Swift and Lorde haven’t been seen together much.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">7.
