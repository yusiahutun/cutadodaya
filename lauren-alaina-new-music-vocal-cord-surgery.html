Everything’s different. I have a new voice, too. It’s a brand new me!” Alaina says.</p><p>The vocal cord surgery did put her on hold for a while, but it wasn’t all bad.</p><p>“I can sing a lot higher and a lot stronger,” she explains. “I have a three-octave range now because of it. For me, that’s a big deal." That's a good thing, by the way — the average vocal range is 1.5 octaves.</p><p>Alaina is ready to dive back in head-first and engage her loyal fans, who she says have been very patient and encouraging throughout the whole process.</p><p>“They’ve been so supportive,” the singer gushes. "I have the best fans. I know everyone says that, but I really think I do, because they stuck around two and a half years for music. That’s a long time to wait for music."</p><p>The album does not yet have a release date, but Alaina says it is very close to being finished. She even wrote all of the songs on the record except one. The first single, "<a href=#>Barefoot and Buckwild</a>," was released in 2013.</p><p>The country singer will 21 this November, but she says she doesn’t have any major plans to go wild. “I plan to have some great music out when I’m 21," Alaina says with a laugh.</p><p><strong>So, You Think You Know 'American Idol' Country Singers?</strong></p><p><strong>American Idol Singers: Where Are They Now?</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpZmlp7KvecClmKKmkWK7psOMpqysoZNiw7CvwKVknKeimXq0wdGgnKuxXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./caitlin-clark-wins-espy-for-best-college-athlete-in-womens-sports.html><span>←</span><span>Hawkeyes Caitlin Clark wins ESPY for best college athlete in womens sports</span></a>
