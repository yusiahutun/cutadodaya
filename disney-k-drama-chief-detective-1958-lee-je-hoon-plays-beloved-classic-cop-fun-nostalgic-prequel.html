In that film, the detectives and their suspect pause a brutal interrogation to tune in to Chief Inspector, with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Song Kang-ho</span></a>’s detective humming along to the theme tune.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Further connecting this newfangled prequel with its progenitor is the show’s present-day opening, which features original star Choi Bool-am reprising his role as the now retired Detective Park Yeong-han, still stomping through his old haunts.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">7 of the best new Korean drama series to watch in April 2024</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee first appears on screen in the present, as the retired detective’s bright-eyed grandson, who has followed in his footsteps into the crime-solving profession.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The series then travels all the way back to the muddy countryside on the outskirts of Seoul in 1958. Lee is now the much younger Detective Park, wrapped up in rags as he goes undercover to track down some cow thieves at a cattle market.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/23/7220c7ad-cbe7-4730-96d0-a6f265488b3b_c4572f0b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He smooth-talks his way into a barnyard gambling den and sits down to play a hand with some slimy gentlemen wearing boxy suits and white leather shoes. He swiftly exposes the hoodlums and is praised by the captain of his quaint provincial precinct for having collared his 96th cow thief.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yeong-han’s success earns him a transfer and he packs his bags for the big city. His reputation as an eager country-bumpkin investigator precedes him but Yeong-han isn’t the type to take jabs lying down. He gives back better than he receives and, before long, his cocky new city-slicker colleagues learn not to mess with him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yeong-han also gains the admiration of his exceedingly jaded new captain Yu Dae-cheon (Choi Deok-moon) when he shoves the manacled criminal Viper down in a chair in the precinct.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/23/f16c9083-8ae3-490d-befb-d878801f1358_c51cca5a.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Everyone scoffed when Yeong-han set out to apprehend the gangster, who is guarded by a brigade of 30 thugs, but armed with his wits and a bag of snakes, he prevailed against the odds.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What the idealistic Yeong-han isn’t prepared for, however, is the rampant corruption in the department. Viper is almost immediately freed and Yeong-han soon learns that most of his fellow detectives are on the take.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fortunately for Yeong-han, he isn’t completely alone. There is his honest captain, whose passion for justice is reawakened by his steadfast new team member, and also the outcast Detective “Mad Dog” Kim Sang-sun (Lee Dong-hwi, Reply 1988), who typically doesn’t play well with others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/23/eee6e999-1f19-4e20-8a0e-07446c82e202_2fc7dfeb.jpg>Over the first few episodes, Yeong-han puts together a new squad of honest cops, which is filled out with Jo Gyeong-hwan (Choi Woo-sung, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">My Roommate Is a Gumiho</span></a>), a beefy street porter who frequently tussles with gangsters, and Seo Ho-jeong (Yoon Hyun-soo, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">A Good Day to Be a Dog</span></a>), a brilliant student from a rich family who goes against his father’s wishes to join the force.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yeong-han also gets some help from the charming bookseller Lee Hye-ju (Seo Eun-soo, The Witch: Part 2. The Other One), hinting at some romance in the show’s future.</p>Rather than capture the essence of the famed Chief Inspector, as originally played by Choi, Lee largely channels his previous performances for his gregarious spin on the part, namely his role in the hit show <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Taxi Driver</span></a> and the titular character he plays in the neo-noir thriller Phantom Detective, who is also a period-era investigator.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/23/c1a122ae-5532-48dc-bc3d-b466fdf75d4b_a38e2bfb.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Though the show has yet to explain where Yeong-han gets his stellar investigation skills from, we do know that the seeds of his idealism were planted by his father. A brewer, his father tells him that “living in this world is like brewing alcohol. You have to filter out the impurities.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some people who remember the original show will be delighted at Detective Park’s return, while others may feel that it shares little with the original, beyond its callbacks. Meanwhile, not being familiar with the original is in no way an impediment to enjoying this lively procedural, which is steeped in an infectious sense of nostalgia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee and the co-stars playing his cohorts are a pleasure to watch as they get up to their inventive crime-fighting antics, and the immersive period detail of the production is well-rendered.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are a few wonky spots, including some misguided altercations with crooked American GIs, but for the most part, Chief Detective 1958 is a welcome blast back to the past.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chief Detective 1958 is streaming on Disney+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLhuvM6pZqRllKeurq2OmqmtoZOhsnB%2FkW9naWtiZLGqv82esGajXZm%2FornAZpqhoZWbeqWx056araGmmnpyhZRxZKWdlWK3pnnHqKanZaChrrq%2FjJucpaemmrFur8uaqqyhk2KwsLyMn6ynZZ6kwLWty6CgnGWgp7KywcSl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./diana-ross-was-married-twice-meet-ex-husbands-robert-and-arne-jr.html><span>←</span><span>Diana Ross Was Married Twice!
