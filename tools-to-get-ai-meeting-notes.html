In this case, it is perhaps best to concentrate on the conversation and let your AI assistant take notes.</p><p>If this sounds like a good idea, read on to find about ten useful tools that can create AI-generated meeting notes.</p><h2 id=otter>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Otter</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/otter-notes-screenshot.jpg><p>Otter is a well-known <a href=#>tool for transcribing meetings</a> and generating automatic meeting notes. Otter does a great job at identifying speakers, showing live transcription, and creating an AI outline/summary for longer meetings. Of course, you can manually highlight items, assign tasks, and add takeaways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What's best about this tool is that you can ask the Otter Assistant to join meetings and take notes on its own even when you can't join the meeting yourself. All you have to do is connect Otter with the meeting scheduled in your calendar in advance and let it take notes.</p><p>It works nicely with Google Meet, Zoom, and Teams and has a mobile app too. Otter has a free plan that allows 300 minutes of monthly transcription. The other two paid plans cost $16.99 and $30 monthly.</p><h2 id=supernormal>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Supernormal</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/supernoral-screenshot.jpg><p>Supernormal is an automatic note-taker that works seamlessly with Google Meet, Zoom, and Teams. Better still, if you have a recording of any previous meeting, you can use Supernormal to generate notes regardless of the meeting platform. The pre-made templates for different kinds of meetings make the notes more presentable and speed up the process.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides notes, it can generate transcripts and record meeting videos as well as audio. Sharing your recordings is simple, too, as you can do so via a link. Supernormal supports English, French, Spanish, and other languages. The free plan lets you record ten meetings each month, while the Pro plan begins at $15 per month and goes up depending on the number of minutes.</p><h2 id=meetgeek>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MeetGeek</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/eetgeek-screenshot.jpg><p>MeetGeek is another tool you can use to record your meetings, generate brief summaries, and share them with your colleagues. The tool can enter and record your Meet, Zoom, or Teams meetings using the meeting invite link. You can also connect your calendar with MeetGeek and allow it to auto-record your meetings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides recording the meeting and generating a transcript, MeetGeek creates short video/audio highlights for important parts of the meeting. It also provides written summaries, stating facts, action items, and concerns. You can add custom keywords that are important to your business, and MeetGeek will make sure to add those parts to the summaries and highlights.</p><p>Other notable features include integration with popular project management tools, meeting templates, and custom branding. Similarly, meeting insights show statistics like silence rate, punctuality, participation, sentiment, etc. The basic plan is free, while Pro and Business cost $15 and $29 per month per user, respectively.</p><h2 id=colibri>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Colibri</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/colibri-transcript-screenshot.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you need a simple, clutter-free tool to record meetings, show real-time transcription, and generate notes, try Colibri. Colibri maintains a searchable library of all your meetings, allowing you to find relevant information easily.</p><p>Colibri can automatically create time-stamped notes, detect topics, and extract customer questions. During the meeting, you can highlight important snippets from the live transcription to add to the notes. You can also create meeting agendas and templates beforehand.</p><p>The supported conferencing tools include Zoom, Meet, Teams, BlueJeans, etc. Colibri has free and two paid plans, costing $20 and $50 per month. However, the AI notes feature is available only for paid accounts.</p><h2 id=notes-by-dubber>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Notes by Dubber</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/notes-by-dubber.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dubber is a call recording software that allows businesses to record meetings, recall them, and gain insights. One of its tools, called Notes by Dubber, helps you focus on your meeting by generating meeting summaries automatically. It transcribes the entire conversation and uses AI to extract action items and create executive summaries.</p><p>It syncs with all popular video conferencing software and automatically records your meetings, transcribing them in real time. You can share the audio recording as well as AI-generated action tasks and summaries with the participants. As it lets you import recordings, you can even create notes for past meetings. Notes by Dubber has two plans, costing $19 and $39 per user per month.</p><h2 id=instaminutes>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instaminutes</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instaniutes-screenshot.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Instaminutes can summarize your lengthy meetings into key takeaways almost instantly. While you're in the meeting, it displays live notes on the side. After the meeting, you can find all the important notes together and quickly go through them again. It works with Meet, Zoom, Webex, and Teams.</p><p>For recording and generating notes, you can either download its Chrome extension or add it to your Google Calendar. Otherwise, you can simply upload audio files and get automatic summaries. What's great about Instaminutes is that you can train its AI. During the meeting, select the points from the live notes that you want to include.</p><p>This helps Instaminutes learn about your requirements and create better notes in the future. If your usage is less than 300 minutes per month, you can choose its free plan. Otherwise, you'll have to upgrade to the Premium, or Small Teams plan for $50 or $84 per month, respectively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sembly>7. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sembly</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sebly-screenshot.jpg><p>Sembly is a smart tool that can generate meeting minutes and summaries, recognizing risks, dates, events, and action items. What's best is that you can give voice commands to Sembly during the meeting to add certain items to your notes so you never miss any important information.</p><p>Sembly integrates with project management and communication tools, letting you <a href=#>organize your notes using Notion</a> or other tools. And if you are too busy to attend a meeting, Sembly can attend it for you and share notes afterward. It is available as a web application and a mobile app. The free plan doesn't allow generating summaries and minutes, so you'll have to upgrade to Professional or higher, which starts at $10 per month.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=avoma>8. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Avoma</a></h2><p>Avoma stands for A Very Organized Meeting Assistant. Living up to its name, Avoma offers numerous features that ensure your meetings go smoothly. One of these features is automatic meeting notes and action items.</p><p>It organizes the meeting summary points in the form of a bullet list, dividing items into appropriate categories. Besides integrating with meeting and calendar tools, Avoma syncs with your CRM and uploads meeting notes automatically.</p><p>Though it can generate notes automatically, there's an option for manual note-taking too. It provides live transcription and can identify speakers, topics, and custom keywords. You'll have to pay $17 per month or higher if you want to access the AI notes feature.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fireflies>9. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fireflies</a></h2><p>Fireflies does everything you'd expect an AI-powered meeting assistant to do. It records and transcribes your meetings in real-time, generates meeting notes with relevant time-stamps, surfaces important action items, dates, times, or highlights from the meeting, and works with all the major video conferencing apps, including Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Skype, and more. Fireflies is also available as an Android app and Chrome extension.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can also connect Fireflies to your calendar and have it automatically join video conferences; that way, you don't have to keep adding the bot to your meetings manually. If you have some pre-recorded audio files of former meetings, you can upload them to Fireflies and have it transcribe them. Your teammates can start a thread discussing specific parts of the call, leave feedback via a like, dislike, or pin button, and create sound bites so that you can jump to important sections.</p><p>Our favorite feature of Fireflies, perhaps, is the AI assistant AskFred. It's like ChatGPT but for meetings. You can ask the assistant to define or translate a word from the video transcription, summarize sections, craft emails and reports, and more. The free plan of Fireflies gets you 800 minutes of total storage. There are three paid plans with additional features: Pro for $10 a month, Business for $19 a month, and Enterprise for a custom fee based on your needs.</p><h2 id=fathom>10. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fathom</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fathom-screenshot.JPG> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fathom is a lot like Fireflies in that it can transcribe your meetings, add highlights to flag anything noteworthy, provide AI-generated summaries, and auto-record all meetings so that you don't have to start the recording manually every time you enter a new meeting. Fathom works with Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet.</p><p>One cool feature of Fathom is that you can divide highlights into different types, including Action Item, Insight, Positive, Feedback, Objection, or Tech Question. This helps you better compartmentalize what was said in the meeting. Also, at the time of writing, Fathom supports seven languages, including English, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, and German. That's not as many languages as Supernormal, but it's definitely more inclusive than some of the other tools on this list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fathom is entirely free to use, although there's a paid Team Edition. The Team Edition has extra enterprise features, such as advanced access control, and comes in two payment plans. Depending on whether you choose to pay monthly or annually, the Standard plan costs $32 or $24 a month, respectively, and the Pro plan costs $39 or $29 a month, respectively.</p><h2 id=use-ai-assistant-to-improve-your-meetings>Use AI Assistant to Improve Your Meetings</h2><p>Taking notes during the meeting can be a hassle, while doing so afterward means spending extra time.
