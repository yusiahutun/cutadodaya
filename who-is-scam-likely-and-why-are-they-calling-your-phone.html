Whenever someone calls you, your cellular carrier checks that number against a database of known scam phone numbers. If it matches a reported scammer, the caller's number is tagged with "Scam Likely" so you can keep your guard up when you answer the call.</p><p>This feature is designed to protect against robocalls, <a href=#>tech support scams</a>, IRS impersonation scams, and really <a href=#>any kind of phone call that attempts to defraud you</a>.</p><p>The "Scam Likely" tag is applied on the carrier's end of things, before the call is even sent to your phone. The tag appears on caller ID, so this works with iPhones, Android phones, and everything else. The setup doesn't require any special software on your phone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a664897d0eb2.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a6648a411f03.png><h2 id=how-to-block-scam-likely-calls>How to Block "Scam Likely" Calls</h2><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Automatically Block Spam Calls on an iPhone</a></span></p><p>Just like with email spam blockers, this anti-scam feature doesn't always work perfectly. It's possible that a legitimate call may get the&nbsp; "Scam Likely" tag. That's why your carrier doesn't just block these calls outright---you still receive them, just in case they're real. That said, it's very unlikely a real call will be tagged as a likely scam, so be sure to keep your guard up if someone on the line says they're from your bank or credit card company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can choose to enable the "Scam Block" feature and automatically block incoming calls tagged as Scam Likely, however. To do so, open your phone's dialer and dial #ONB# (or #662#). Incoming "Scam Likely" calls will be blocked before they ever reach your phone. To disable the Scam Block feature and receive these calls once again, dial #OFB# (or #632#). To check whether Scam Block is on or off, dial #787#.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Block Spam Calls and Texts in Android, Manually and Automatically</a></span></p><p>You can also use other tricks to block scammy phone calls. iPhones offer a way to <a href=#>automatically block spammy phone calls</a> and <a href=#>text messages</a>, and Android phones also allow you to <a href=#>block junk phone calls</a>. These tricks work even with other cellular carriers, so anyone with a modern phone can use them. You can also use these tricks even if you're already using T-Mobile's "Scam Likely" setup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Android's standard dialer also now shows warnings about suspected spam callers, so you may see similar warnings on Android, too, no matter which carrier you use. The wording is just a bit different.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a6648b52dde9.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_5a6648bd4425c.png><p>If you don't want to see the "Scam Likely" tag at all, T-Mobile says you can contact their customer support or go to a retail store and ask them to disable the Scam ID feature. But we don't see much reason to disable it. Even if it's occasionally wrong, it'll give you a heads up before you're about to answer a call from a known scammer's phone number.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhqbWhhbn9ww8eoZKKrXaiwormMpaCknZyueqK6w2auobFdlr%2BmedOhnLJlk5a5rbXNoGSyp6WnerG0zqecaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-make-kodi-automatically-play-the-next-episode-like-netflix-does.html><span>←</span><span>How to Make Kodi Automatically Play the Next Episode (Like Netflix Does)</span></a>
