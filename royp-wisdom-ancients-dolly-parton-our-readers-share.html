But if studying is what we have to do, I always remind myself that sometimes you just need to be nice to yourself and do something you love. It’s a huge waste of time when you do something you hate. Therefore, the quote reminds me that, although at times it might be difficult, the most important thing is that you are happy, and that you should never be afraid of being unique and different.</span></p><p><h4 type=h4><span type=text>Valerie Chiu (17)</span></h4></p><span type=hr></span><h3 type=h3><a href=# class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><u type=u><span type=text>ROYP: From Camus to Three Idiots, our readers tell us what keeps them going</span></u></a></h3><span type=hr></span><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=span><span type=text>Hey guys!
