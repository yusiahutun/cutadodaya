(One of them even attended a concert by the Beatles.)

However, Reality Steve revealed that filming of the show began on August 3 and hometowns kicked off three weeks later.</p><p>Reality Steve mentioned that only one month would be spent filming, thus this timeline works out wonderfully.

She is a high school teacher and ” ‘Faith loves riding her horse, Liberty, through the mountains.’ Oooh, she’s outdoorsy… just like our Golden Bachelor!”</p><p>The other two women Gerry will have his hometown dates with are <a href=#>Theresa</a> and <a href=#>Leslie</a>.</p><p>After the names of 22 women were made official, Faith took to her Facebook and wrote, “Thank you so much, Monica!
