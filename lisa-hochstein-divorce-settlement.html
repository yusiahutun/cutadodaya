The couple married in 2009 and share two children: son Logan and daughter Elle. In his&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>divorce filing</a>, which was obtained by Page Six, Lenny stated that his “marriage is irretrievably broken and there is no present hope for a meaningful reconciliation.” The filing also notes that Lenny and Lisa signed a prenuptial agreement before they married which requires him to pay spousal support to Lisa.</p><p>“I didn’t anticipate this to happen in front of the world. My soon-to-be ex even said to me that he was contemplating waiting until after the show aired to drop this bomb on me,” Lisa told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TV Insider</a>&nbsp;in March 2023 about her and Lenny’s split playing out in&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Miami&nbsp;Season 5. “For whatever reason, he decided to drop it. I questioned him asking, ‘Why would you do this?’ It’s super embarrassing. It’s not something I want to show to the world. I <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/lists/lisa-hochstein-boyfriend/>wasn’t prepared</a> for that. I was totally blindsided. There are people who have said that I knew this was coming. I absolutely did not know this was coming. He even asked me to have a third child, discussing this among friends at a dinner two weeks before. We would do date nights and movie nights. We were just in Aspen and planning to go to a wedding in Italy with some friends. There are so many things that happened where I thought we were happy. Then boom. He dropped the bomb.”</p><p>So what is Lisa Hochstein’s divorce settlement from Lenny?

She moved out of her ex-husband’s house&nbsp;and into an ultra-luxurious, 5,586-square-feet condo with a $32,000-per-month price tag, but is looking for more potential options.</p><p>“I love the size of this house,” she said in a January 17, 2024 episode where she toured a $5.387 million house. “This is a wonderful, perfect size for me to raise my family in.”</p><p>Lisa admitted that she didn’t know how to pay for the house on her own, “I don’t know because it’s really up to —&nbsp;ultimately Lenny’s decision. This would be part of a settlement.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I do need his support,” she continued. “Because we do have two kids together, and I was married to him for so long.”</p><p>In early 2023, the two agreed on a temporary settlement of $8,000 paid towards Lisa, but Lenny fought to withdraw in August 2023. “Lisa came up with an agreement in June. I thought it would have been something that made her happy and allow her to move on because it’s far more generous than our premarital agreement stipulated,” Lenny told&nbsp;<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lenny-hochstein-on-why-he-wants-to-withdraw-lisa-divorce-settlement/ rel=nofollow>Us Weekly </a>at the time. “Lisa will never be happy.
