But she didn’t earn a salary as FLOTUS. She started out as a model at 16 years old and has <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">jewellery and skin care lines</span></a> in her portfolio of businesses.

According to Mary Jordan’s The Art of Her Deal book that was released years later, Melania held off on moving to Washington DC as she was actually renegotiating her prenup to ensure her only son with Donald would be entitled to a fairer share of his dad’s fortune.

She has also married three more times since then, with one of her weddings taking place at Donald’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

In 2015, his campaign claimed his wealth had risen to US$10 billion when in fact it was estimated to be US$4.1 billion. In 2018, he told Fox News that he estimated his move into politics would cause him to lose US$2 billion to US$3 billion. In 2020, his net worth dropped to US$2.1 billion, CNN reports. But by 2022, it had risen again to US$3 billion with his new social media network Truth Social contributing to the figure by US$430 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpydnJqvs7XTsmaaqqSesK2xjmxocHFnZ4Jww8eoZJqqlWK%2Fqq%2FHnqqtZaSnwq68jJ%2BYpqGcrnquscybnKurXaOytXnWqKmtoKNiv6K6yp6b</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./simplest-spaghetti-al-limone.html><span>←</span><span>simplest spaghetti allimone</span></a>
