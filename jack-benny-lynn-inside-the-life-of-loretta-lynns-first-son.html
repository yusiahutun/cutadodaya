<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Jack Benny Lynn: Inside the Life of Loretta Lynn's First Son</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Jack Benny Lynn is the late son of the late American country singer Loretta Lynn. He was the second son of the late singer and her husband, Oliver “Doolittle” Lynn. Born in the late 1940s, Jack did not pursue an entertainment career like his parents and siblings. Instead, the Tennessee-born celebrity kid had a natural penchant as an outdoorsman. Hence, he became a blacksmith, horse trainer, horseback rider, and ranchman.</p><p>Unfortunately, Jack passed away in his thirties, leaving behind a heartbroken mother. At his death, Loretta was on tour and checked into a hospital after falling unconscious due to extreme exhaustion. Hence, Doolittle traveled from Tennessee to deliver the news in person to the country singer.&nbsp;</p><p>Jack’s death left a gap in the Grammy Award-winning singer’s heart as she had a special affection for him. Here’s everything we know about the late celebrity kid and the circumstances surrounding his death.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-06_05-07-36-fotor-2023100652611.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Jack_Benny_Lynn_Die></span>How Did Jack Benny Lynn Die?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While there have been several reports regarding how Loretta Lynn’s son died, only one account is accurate. Jack Benny Lynn tragically drowned on July 22, 1984, while attempting to cross Duck River with his horse, another hobby.</p><p>However, a rescue team found and retrieved his body and unharmed horse from the river on the family’s Hurricane Mills property. Although Loretta was away at the time of his death, the news took a toll on her.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the singer’s biography, her now-deceased son was the one she felt most tenderly towards. Before her death in October 2022, Loretta still paid tributes to Jack. In 2021, the country singer shared a sentimental Instagram post about his death, stating that she has missed him every day for the almost four decades since he passed.&nbsp;</p><p>The still-grieving mom penned, “He was a spitting image of his daddy. He was my blond-headed, blue-eyed baby. Just what I asked for. He was quiet and tender. I adored him with all my heart.” In addition, she stated that even though it caused her heartbreak, she would do it all again. Loretta also expressed how a parent will never be the same after losing a child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-06_05-07-46-fotor-2023100652513-714x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Was_Jack_Benny_Lynns_Cause_of_Death></span>What Was Jack Benny Lynn’s Cause of Death?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Loretta Lynn’s son, Jack, died from drowning. According to the late singer, Jack Benny Lynn enrolled in the army after he graduated high school. However, he was more content at home, tending to the animals on the ranch, where he became a great horseman, making his tragic demise more dreadful and unexpected.&nbsp;</p><p>In December 2021, Loretta shared another Instagram post in tribute to her son; she wrote, “Today’s my Jack’s birthday. He was born a year and two weeks after my Betty Sue. I was so young that we practically raised each other, but they were my life.”&nbsp;</p><p>She continued to write about how her kids were sometimes tricky to handle but were always fun. The post revealed, however, via her grief-stricken words, “I still can’t believe they’re both gone,” that Jack was not her only child who had died.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Was_Loretta_Lynns_Sons_Age_When_He_Died></span>What Was Loretta Lynn’s Son’s Age When He Died?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The horseback trainer was 34. Jack Benny Lynn was born on&nbsp; December 7, 1949, in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, United States. In her autobiography, “Coal Miner’s Daughter,” Loretta joked that they gave their first son this name for two reasons. The first one was because it was the name of her favorite comedian, and the second was because people from the South always liked using two names.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-06_05-07-42-fotor-2023100652547.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Jack_Benny_Lynns_Siblings></span>Who Are Jack Benny Lynn’s Siblings?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Jack Benny Lynn was the second of <a href=#>Loretta Lynn’s children</a>, he was the firstborn son in his family. However, he had five siblings from his parent’s marriage. First is Betty Sue Lynn, born on November 26, 1948.</p><p>Much like her mom, Betty became a phenomenal songwriter. She penned Loretta’s “Wine, Women and Song” lyrics and “The Home You’re Tearin’ Down.” However, Betty Sue died at 64 of complications from emphysema on July 29, 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>Next is Clara “Cissoe” Marie Lynn, born on April 7, 1952. Like her mom, Cissie spent much of her music career on the road, opening for some of country music’s biggest stars like George Jones, Mel McDaniel, and Conway Twitty. However, she married singer-songwriter John Beams, Loretta’s driver for nearly 20 years.</p><p>After Cissie comes Ernest Ray Lynn. Born on May 27, 1954, in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee, Ernest is the couple’s second son together. Like his mom and older siblings, Ernest also had a passion for music. Consequently, he often joined his mom as her opener and bandmate on the road.&nbsp;</p><p>Last is Peggy Jean Lynn and Patsy Eileen Lynn, Jack Benny Lynn’s twin sisters. Loretta and Doolittle welcomed their twin daughters, Peggy and Patsy, on August 6, 1964. While they named Peggy after Loretta’s sister, Peggy Sue, they named Patsy after her mother’s late dear friend and country music legend Patsy Cline. Peggy and Patsy followed in their mother’s footsteps like their older siblings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/photo_2023-10-06_05-07-52-fotor-2023100652435.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jack_Benny_Lynns_Funeral></span>Jack Benny Lynn’s Funeral<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After his tragic death, around 300 mourners attended Jack Benny Lynn’s funeral at the family plot at Hurricane Mills. Some attendees include country music stars Tammy Wynette and Crystal Gayle and Jack’s children.</p><p>When alive, Loretta’s first son married twice. He first married his high school girlfriend, Pat. Together, they had two children, Lora Kay and Jeffrey Allen. However, they divorced years later for unknown reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Afterward, Jack Benny Lynn tied the knot with his second wife, Barbara, and remained her husband until he died in the mid-’80s. Jack and his second wife had a daughter, Jenny. However, like James Gandolfini’s wife, <a href=#>Deborah Lin</a>, Jack’s wife has kept a low profile since his death.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kt6KvymaZnqaernqtxc2nZKKmo56xpnnToZxmpJmbsm67xWajqKqVqcGiecuypaerXZu2s7%2FTZqqopl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./crimean-people-celebrate-liberation-russian-soldiers-arrive-balaclava.html><span>←</span><span>Crimean people celebrate 'liberation' as Russian soldiers arrive in Balaclava</span></a>
