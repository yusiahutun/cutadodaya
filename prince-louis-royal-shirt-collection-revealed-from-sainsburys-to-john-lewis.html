They were looking at the clothes when I saw them. Charlotte was looking at the dresses, she was dead cute."</p><p id=efd3fEBhj-u data-wc=19>Also in 2020, William and Kate shared an adorable video of their children posing questions to Sir David Attenborough.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Twitter</a><p id=e6HSoyqIwtP data-wc=68>It was the first time the public had heard Louis speak in public – and he looked cute as a button in a striped white, blue and red jumper with buttons at the neckline.
