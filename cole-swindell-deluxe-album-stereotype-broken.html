The guitar lick in the intro just grabs you and doesn’t let you go,” Swindell says in a press release. “I’m not sure if there is such thing as a fun breakup song but that’s kind of what this is. Glad it’s finally out and can’t wait to get out there and play it live.”</p><p>"It reminds me of something that could have come out in the '90s, or come out five years ago or this week," he adds in an <a href=#>interview</a> with Taste of Country’s Evan Paul, alluding to the resurgence of ‘90s country. “Obviously that sound is popular again ... it just had that feeling of, I don't know.
