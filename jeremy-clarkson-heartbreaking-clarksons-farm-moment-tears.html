My mother used to buy me toy pigs every Christmas and birthday. I thought it'd be fun to have them and then they just died in alarming numbers and it was very heartbreaking. I’ve never seen Lisa cry, not once ever until that all started unfolding. It was just terrible.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f86a4a91513e-eob7076eob3000.jpg><p id=evB66IC5zDx data-wc=35>He added: "They still die but we're getting more used to it now. We're a bit more robust. We're a bit stronger at dealing with it now, but it was a very heartbreaking time there.”&nbsp;</p><p id=evPCU-VWp5M data-wc=81>Lisa also spoke about raising pigs on the farm, admitting that she doesn’t like it when they go to the abattoir. She said: “I don't want to drive them there. I have other things to do… but it's very satisfying when loads of piglets are born, and they have such a great life running up and down that bank and snuffling away. I think all the trees actually might fall over because they're now getting to the bottom of the roots.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/df52f5b645c9-eob7478eob3000.jpg><p id=eKRFLpciiX data-wc=63>She continued: “But it's satisfying because they’re born to breed. They're farm animals. The one thing I will do for next year is bring a lot more venison because that is just superb and we found a really good venison butcher. We have way too many deer they need to be culled so we want integrate that more and venison sausages are amazing.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Inside Jeremy Clarkson's private life with Lisa Hogan: their courtship, THAT proposal scene and convincing her to leave London" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/061d4bf01078-jeremy-clarkson-lisa-hogan-clarksons-farm-premiere.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Inside Jeremy Clarkson's private life with Lisa Hogan: their courtship, THAT proposal scene and convincing her to leave London" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Inside Jeremy Clarkson's private life with Lisa Hogan: their courtship, THAT proposal scene and convincing her to leave London</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Jeremy Clarkson's future at Diddly Squat Farm hangs in the balance amid health scare" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/851cef958bf9-gettyimages-1958359233.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Jeremy Clarkson's future at Diddly Squat Farm hangs in the balance amid health scare" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Jeremy Clarkson's future at Diddly Squat Farm hangs in the balance amid health scare</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=ek6seGwZVzXu data-wc=43>While Jeremy and Lisa have gotten more used to saying farewell to their pigs, there is one animal that they’re not planning on getting right of, goats!
