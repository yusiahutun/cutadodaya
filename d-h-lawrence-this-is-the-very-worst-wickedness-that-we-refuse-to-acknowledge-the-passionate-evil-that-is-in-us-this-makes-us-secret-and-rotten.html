<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>D. H. Lawrence: 'This is the very worst wickedness, that we refuse to acknowledge the passionate evi</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>This is the very worst wickedness, that we refuse to acknowledge the passionate evil that is in us. This makes us secret and rotten.</p><p>D. H. Lawrence, the renowned English writer, once said, "This is the very worst wickedness, that we refuse to acknowledge the passionate evil that is in us. This makes us secret and rotten." This insightful quote powerfully highlights the significance of recognizing and confronting the darker aspects of our nature. Lawrence acknowledges that denying the existence of our passionate evil leads us to become covert and corrupt. The quote's straight-forward meaning urges individuals to reflect on their own inner demons and the consequences of neglecting them. However, delving deeper into this concept, an unexpected philosophical perspective emerges, shedding new light on the quote's implications.The unexpected philosophical concept that intertwines with Lawrence's quote is Friedrich Nietzsche's theory of the "shadow self." Nietzsche explored the idea of the "shadow" as the concealed, suppressed, or hidden side of our personality. He believed that embracing and integrating this shadow self was essential for individual growth and self-actualization. By integrating our passionate evil or shadow self, we confront and understand the true nature of our desires, instincts, and emotions. Rather than rejecting or denying these aspects, Nietzsche argued that acknowledging and accepting them gives us the power to control and channel them constructively.Comparing Lawrence's quote to Nietzsche's theory reveals striking parallels. Both emphasize the negative consequences of refusing to acknowledge the passionate evil or the shadow self within us. Lawrence's notion of secrecy and rottenness aligns with Nietzsche's idea that suppressing our shadow causes it to fester and grow stronger, ultimately leading to internal conflict and moral degradation. Both writers urge us to confront and integrate the darker aspects of our personality to avoid destructive consequences.However, while Lawrence focuses on the negative impact of denying our passionate evil, Nietzsche takes a more nuanced approach. He suggests that integrating these aspects of ourselves actually leads to personal growth, creativity, and mental well-being. Nietzsche believed that when we confront and understand our shadow selves, we can harness their energy and convert it into fulfilling and meaningful endeavors. By acknowledging our passionate evil, we not only avoid the destructive consequences Lawrence warns against but also tap into a wellspring of authenticity and personal power.In summary, D. H. Lawrence's quote encapsulates the harmful consequences of refusing to acknowledge the passionate evil within us. It urges us to confront our darker nature and avoid secrecy and moral decay. However, with the introduction of Friedrich Nietzsche's theory of the shadow self, a surprising contrast emerges. Nietzsche suggests that embracing our shadow selves can lead to personal growth and transformation. While Lawrence focuses solely on the negative implications, Nietzsche brings forth a more optimistic perspective, encouraging us to integrate and channel our passionate evil for constructive purposes. Ultimately, this quote invites us to consider the importance of self-awareness and the complexity of our own nature, inspiring us to explore the balance between embracing and controlling our shadow selves for our own well-being and personal development.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyywc6tnGallZa7qrrGrGadZZhiuaLD0Z6lnJ1dqbWqv4yiqmasmJp6t7HRsmSwp6KowW7DyJyinpyemsC0edOhmK1lp5p6s7HFrqqeZaSkeqKvyqemsKSVmbSmedOhnGaokajAqrvNmqueZZWrtq1506GYrWWZqHqquoyuqmasmJ7AbrnApJysZaWoerSxwqucrWWRo7Fuvs6tq56m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chinese-biotech-firm-clover-signs-deal-make-millions-covid-19.html><span>←</span><span>Chinese biotech firm Clover signs deal to make millions of Covid-19 vaccines for Covax Facility</span></a>
