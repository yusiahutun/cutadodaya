The crew started filming again at the start of 2024. Speaking about the storyline, the&nbsp;film’s official synopsis reads, "Lily Bloom thinks she's found the love of her life in Ryle Kincaid. However, after a troubling incident of abuse reminds her of her dark past, she must decide if love alone can carry her marriage through. Further complicating things is the return of her first love into her life: a man who she took in many years prior when he was homeless.”</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h2 id=661f5bd0e6bbc><strong>Why did It Ends With Us face backlash?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The movie faced backlash from fans even before the filming commenced. Fans didn't like it when the official cast was revealed. They pointed out that Blake and Lively were too old to play the role of Justin and Ryle. Colleen Hoover had to come out and defend the casting choices by pointing out the inconsistencies in her book and stating that it was “her fault.”<br>The author spoke to Today regarding her writing and explained how she messed up. “Back when I wrote It Ends With Us, the new adult was very popular. You were writing college-age characters. That's what I was contracted to do. I made Lily very young,” the writer justified. She then expanded on how while writing the book she did not realize that neurosurgeons went to school for a significant number of years. She added, "There's not a 20-something neurosurgeon.” Hoover explained how when the movie was being made she realized that the characters had to be “aged out” to make the story more realistic. She acknowledged that she “messed up” and it was her fault</p><p><strong>ALSO READ:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","When Will Blake Lively’s It Ends With Us Hit Theatres?
