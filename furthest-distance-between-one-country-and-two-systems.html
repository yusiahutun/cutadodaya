Also, understandably, when Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping came up with this innovative idea decades ago, neither he nor Beijing could foresee all the future complexities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/22/12ac0f3a-2483-11ea-acfb-1fd6c5cf20a4_1320x770_192535.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The current inconvenient reality speaks volumes: Hong Kong seems to have moved further away from, rather than drawn closer to, mainland China because of different interpretations of the relation between “one country” and “two systems”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The unprecedented political divide stemming from more than six months of protests further amplifies the deep-rooted problem: protesters and their supporters believe they are fighting for democracy, a “revolution of our times” as they put it, but the pro-establishment camp and Beijing in particular see the social unrest as a threat to national security and challenge to “one country”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">One country, two protests – two consequences?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The US factor in this saga has further complicated the situation. This well explains why Xi warned in Macau that there was “no need for any foreign force to dictate things to us” regarding how to handle the two special administrative regions’ internal affairs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The next day Xi expressed to President Donald Trump China’s deep concerns over Washington’s attitude towards Hong Kong, Taiwan, Xinjiang and Tibet when the two leaders discussed trade and other issues over the phone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/12/22/efb92c00-2483-11ea-acfb-1fd6c5cf20a4_1320x770_192535.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Here’s the irony: when one country, two systems is hailed by all as the best for Hong Kong, and for the country, the chance of forging a wider consensus on a mutually agreeable definition of this concept is getting slimmer under the political confrontation currently intensifying in this city.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To borrow from a well-cited poem: “The furthest distance in the world is not between life and death, but that between fish and bird, one is in the sky, another is in the sea.” But “one country” and “two systems” are not and should not be like fish and bird, unable to meet.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A meeting point between the two sides must be identified through rebuilding mutual trust between Hong Kong and Beijing.
