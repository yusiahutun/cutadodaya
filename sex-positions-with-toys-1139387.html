There are so many great <a href=#>sex positions with sex toys</a>&nbsp;that couples rarely explore, and it’s about darn time said positions get the hype they deserve. From the Best Seat In The House to the Choose Your Own Adventure, there are tons of ways to incorporate sex toys like vibrators and strap-ons into your next love-making sesh, and I’ve rounded up seven guaranteed-to-please positions below, plus some toys you’ll definitely want to Add To Cart before your next booty call.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>Some of you might be wondering, why would anyone want to use a sex toy during intercourse? Isn’t the point of sex to connect with your real-life partner? Of course it is—but <a href=#>sex toys</a> don’t necessarily diminish that connection; in fact, they can even enhance it. Finding new ways to pleasure one another and giving your sex life a much-needed refresh can work wonders for a relationship, and bring a couple closer together. Don’t be shy about asking your partner to bring sex toys into the bedroom: once they see how much you’re enjoying them, they’ll be on board in a heartbeat.</p><p>As for which sex toys work best for couples, it largely depends on <a href=#>the position</a>, which is why knowing your setup is key when selecting a toy before playtime. Read on for seven mega-sexy positions in which you and your partner can experiment with toys—spoiler alert, most are fun takes on classic positions, so you won’t feel like a fish out of water.
