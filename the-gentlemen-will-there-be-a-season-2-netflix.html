"That was something I was I was pushing for in this series, but with an ensemble this big and with as many plot lines and storylines to wrestle with we didn't really find the space for it," he explained, adding that he'd love to see more of Joely Richardson, who plays Lady Sabrina, and Chanel Cresswell, who plays Freddy's wife Tammy. "<strong>They're both just such heavyweights and such awesome people</strong>. There's there's so much room to grow there in terms of them wanting to protect Freddy," he said.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9683802cce00-tg101unit01269-1newrt.jpg><p id=ePj38mnge_w data-wc=40>While Daniel hasn't heard anything about a new series, he'll no doubt be keen to work with Ritchie again.
