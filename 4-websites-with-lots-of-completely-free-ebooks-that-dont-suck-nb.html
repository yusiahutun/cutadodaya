So, take a seat, grab your laptop, and prepare to immerse yourself in a wonderful story.</p><h2 id=planet-ebook>1. <a href=#>Planet EBook</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/PlanetEbookFreeEbooks-Web.jpg><p>Planet eBook is an attractive site that offers classic literature for free. Some books are out of copyright and are offered to you in an entirely legal fashion. But, be sure to click the <strong>Copyright & Usage</strong> link on the ebook details page for any restrictions on that particular book.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Right now, Planet eBook offers just over 80 books, all of which have been carefully selected. True, you will not have the buffet of thousands that you may find on other sites, but you can rest assured that each and every piece of writing on Planet eBook is of outstanding quality.</p><p>All books on the site can be downloaded as a PDF, EPUB, or MOBI file for reading at any time. So, you can enjoy titles like Wuthering Heights, A Tale of Two Cities, or Great Expectations without distractions. Again, the selection may not be enormous on Planet eBook; however, if you want a quick and easy way to find the best of best when it comes to the classics, this site delivers.</p><h2 id=manybooks>2. <a href=#>ManyBooks</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ManyBooksFreeEbooks-Web.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>ManyBooks works in the same way as Planet eBook, offering classic literature for free. However, where Planet eBook presents a carefully selected array of literature, ManyBooks handles everything in bulk (as the name truthfully implies).</p><p>At the time of writing, there are over 50,000 free and discounted books available and the majority of those are available for many readers. Plus, you can read online or download your pick as a PDF, EPUB, MOBI, or similar file format.</p><p>To find a book, you can browse by genre, author, title, trending, or language. You can also look through the editor’s picks or search for a particular book or author.</p><p>As a bonus, you can subscribe to the ManyBooks email newsletter to get deals delivered straight to your inbox. Overall, ManyBooks is a solid way to find free ebooks worth reading.</p><h2 id=classic-reader-broken-url-removed>3. Classic Reader [Broken URL Removed]</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ClassicReaderMain.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Classic Reader resides somewhere between Planet eBook and ManyBooks. It offers a large selection of fiction, non-fiction, classical, drama, and young reader options. You can also browse through the poetry and short story sections for some light reading.</p><p>Once you choose a book, you can read it online. Since the site employs a basic UI, this makes reading those books you choose a nice, unobtrusive experience. Each book’s table of contents makes it easy to pick up on the chapter you left off when reading online. And, if you sign up for a free account you can download books as well.</p><p>Classic Reader may not have as many titles as some other sites, with just under 4,000 at the time of writing. However, you can still enjoy a classic from Charles Dickens, Jules Verne, or H.G. Wells. And, if you have a favorite author, you can view all ebooks available from that author besides their biography. Overall, Classic Reader may not be the prettiest of this bunch, but it is definitely worth checking out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=project-gutenberg>4. <a href=#>Project Gutenberg</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ProjectGutenbergFreeEbooks-Web.jpg><p>With almost 60,000 free ebooks, you will definitely find a good read on the Project Gutenberg site.
