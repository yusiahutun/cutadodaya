In addition, Burke has mixed ethnicity from her Irish father and British mother.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, when the actress was two years old, her mother succumbed to cancer. A neighbouring <a href=#>family</a> known as the Galvins raised Kathy because her father was an alcoholic and often abusive. The foster family raised Kathy until she turned six, then she went back to live with her father and brothers.</p><p class=align-left>Sadly, her father also passed away in 1994 after he also died from cancer. The filmmaker, who developed a passion for acting at a young age, attended <a href=#>Maria</a> Fidelis RC Convent School.

The two appeared in a play together when they were teenagers.</p><p class=align-left>Kathy fell in love with Gary, and he offered to sleep with her, but she refused, saying that it would have been all about him and not Kathy.
