From “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>get ready with me</a>” videos to hilarious pranks (and even some proof that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Kim may now be a Swiftie</a>), the pair is constantly sharing behind-the-scenes looks into their lives with their millions of followers. The latest video to grace our feeds? An iconic mother-daughter lip-sync collaboration that featured one unexpected (but incredibly familiar) face.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Monday, Kardashian and West, who she shares with ex Kanye West, teamed up with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mariah Carey</a> and her daughter Monroe, who she shares with ex Nick Cannon, to film an adorable TikTok featuring Carey’s famous track, “It’s a Wrap.” In the clip, which Kim also posted to her personal TikTok account, 9-year-old North and 11-year-old Monroe are seen performing a dance routine to the song while mouthing the lyrics before their moms hop in the frame to join them, singing into hair brushes all the while.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clearly not wanting the SKIMS founder and singer to steal their spotlight, the girls then playfully pushed their moms out of frame with giggles all around.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Its a wrap! But never for us!” Kardashian, who wore a black tank top and sweatpants in the clip, captioned the video. For her part, Carey looked a bit more glam for the occasion in a white patterned jacket paired with black leather pants and heeled booties.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>tiktok/kim kardashian</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Naturally, fans were quick to flood the video's comments to voice what we were all thinking after witnessing such a legendary collab: “Imagine casually inviting Mariah Carey to your house,” one user wrote while a separate commenter added, “I did not expect that…iconic.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yqKkZqORp7Giv8eimKdlnZa%2Fqq3HZpqaqpWueqWt1KCfrZ2iqHq1tcqtpqRllJa7pLGMcGhqaWhthA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessie-james-decker-reveals-sex-baby-no-4.html><span>←</span><span>Jessie James Decker Reveals the Sex of Baby No. 4</span></a>
