That season <a href=#>ended on something of a cliffhanger</a>, with Cal (Justin Bruening) getting arrested following an altercation at Sullivan’s, Ryan’s (Michael Shenefelt) surprise proposal to Helen (Heather Headley), and the shocking revelation that Maddie’s (JoAnna Garcia Swisher) ex Bill (Chris Klein) was Isaac’s (Chris Medlin) father. Plus, Dana Sue (Brooke Elliott) reunited with her estranged husband Ronnie (Brandon Quinn).&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_63>The finale also introduced a mysterious woman from Dana Sue’s past. <a href=#>The stranger slashed Dana Sue’s tires</a> and accosted her daughter Annie (Anneliese Judge). But who she is and why she’s so mad at Dana Sue remains to be seen. There’s also the matter of who will become the next mayor of Serenity, as well as Annie’s clandestine romance with Jackson (Sam Ashby).&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_42>Clearly, there’s a lot to unpack in Sweet Magnolias Season 3. Fortunately, we don’t have too much longer to wait for new episodes. All 10 episodes of the show’s third season will hit Netflix on Thursday, July 20 at 12 a.m. PT.&nbsp;</p><h2>What to expect from the new season of ‘Sweet Magnolias’&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sweet_Magnolias_Season-3-Maddie.jpg><p id=par-5_35>Fans will have to tune in to find out what happens to Maddie, Helen, Dana Sue, and the rest of Serenity’s residents. But a synopsis from Netflix gives us an idea of what to expect.&nbsp;</p><p>Following the brawl at Sullivan’s, Maddie wrestles with the best way to help Cal and works to clear her own emotional path. Helen faces difficult decisions about the men in her life. And Dana Sue searches for a way to use Miss Frances’ check to help the community, without upending her family. The identity of the tire slasher sends shockwaves through Serenity, the recall causes unexpected consequences, and there are romantic surprises in every generation. Throughout the season, the ladies tackle these problems — and all the complications they cause — with their trademark warmth, humor, and devotion to each other and those they love. And margaritas.</p><h2 id=h-sweet-magnolias-season-3-cast>‘Sweet Magnolias’ Season 3 cast&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sweet_Magnolias-Season-3-Dana-Sue-Helen-Maddie.jpg><p id=par-6_57>Of course, the three core magnolias – Maddie, Helen, and Dane Sue – will be back for Sweet Magnolias ‘ third season.
