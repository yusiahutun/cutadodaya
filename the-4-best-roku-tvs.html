But with a Roku-powered TV, that goes a bit deeper, simplifying things like configuring display settings and switching input channels. We've sought the best Roku TVs so you don't have to do that digging yourself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=update-9-12-21>UPDATE: 9/12/21</h3><p>Checked content for accuracy.</p><h2 id=what-to-look-for-in-a-roku-tv>What to Look for in a Roku TV</h2><p>While Roku may be the largest draw of these TVs, they still need to do well when it comes to basic TV features as well.</p><ul><li><strong>Resolution:&nbsp;</strong>This is one of the most notable differences when it comes to a TV's quality. As you climb up the resolution ladder, prices go up as expected. But for the most part, TVs today either use 1080p or 4K resolution. 4K is superior, providing a much clearer image than 1080p, but for smaller screens, 1080p can still look very sharp. 4K displays also typically have some form of HDR support, with the two forms of HDR featured on this list being HDR10 and Dolby Vision (with <a href=#>subtle differences</a> between the two<a href=#>)</a>. We'll mention which forms of HDR each 4K TV supports, just know HDR basically makes colors more accurate and generally improves the picture quality of the display.</li><li><strong>Refresh Rate:&nbsp;</strong>The refresh rate represents what frame rate TVs can display. For example, a 60 Hz display is capable of outputting at 60 frames per second (or FPS). While most shows and movies are filmed in 24 FPS, video games and online content from sites like YouTube tend to take advantage of higher frame rates, so we'll be sure to mention the refresh rate for each TV.</li><li><strong>Screen Size:&nbsp;</strong>The most popular size for TVs is 65 inches, and as such, that is what most of the models on this list are. Still, it's important to remember even 65-inch models can take up a lot of space, so we've included a smaller TV at the end of this list, the <a href=#>Hisense H4</a>, for those with limited space.</li><li><strong>Display Type:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>LED, OLED, QLED</a>, and <a href=#>Mini-LED</a>---while these may sound similar they are extremely important for determining how a TV will look when it comes to color accuracy and brightness. For example, OLED displays offer brighter colors and deeper black levels than LED displays, and Mini-LED displays tend to be even more color accurate. While LED is the standard display you'll find on a lot of inexpensive TVs, more expensive models feature these alternative panel types to bring a higher quality picture to your living room.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=best-overall-tcl-6-series>Best Overall: TCL 6-Series</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/f3ccdd27-7.jpg> TCL<p>If you're looking for the highest-quality TV on this list, then the TCL 6-Series is it. Besides having Roku built-in, it's just a straight-up good TV for a great price. The 4K, Mini-LED QLED panel looks fantastic, aided by HDR10 and Dolby Vision to ensure colors pop off the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;And with four HDMI ports, you shouldn't have any issues plugging in your favorite devices.</p><p>The TCL 6-Series is a competent gaming display as well. It supports refresh rates of up to 120 Hz (only at 1440p though, at 4K the max refresh rate supported is 60 Hz), and includes gaming targeted features to improve frame rates and latency. This TV is a great deal for the price and is what we recommend to anyone who's looking for a quality Roku TV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h5 class=display-card-title>TCL 6-Series 65-Inch</h5><span>Best Overall</span><p class=display-card-description>The highest quality Roku TV on the market.</p><a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">Shop Now</a><h2 id=a-mid-range-pick-tcl-5-series>A Mid-Range Pick: TCL 5-Series</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/156005c5-6.jpg> TCL<p>While the 5-Series is a step-down from the 6-Series, the much lower price makes it an excellent middle-of-the-road option. Much like the 6-Series, this is a 4K TV with support for HDR10 and Dolby Vision HDR, along with a 120 Hz refresh rate (same rules apply though, 120 Hz doesn't work at 4K). It even includes a gaming mode to lower latency, and you can find four HDMI ports on the back for connecting additional devices.</p><p>The biggest difference between the two is the display; the 5-Series uses a standard QLED display instead of a Mini-LED QLED display like the 6-Series. So while it won't be able to match the 6-Series to a tee, the 5-Series still puts out a great-looking picture that, for the price, is hard to be disappointed by. The 5-Series is yet another fantastic value from TCL.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/51cvvioxhxl-_sl500_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>TCL 5-Series 65-Inch</h5><span>A Mid-Range Pick</span><p class=display-card-description>A middle-of-the-road option that still delivers excellent picture quality.</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">See at Amazon</a><h2 id=budget-choice-onn-line>Budget Choice: onn.

And while it won't win any awards for picture quality, does a fine enough job for the money. It uses a DLED display (an alternative for standard LED displays which typically have more even brightness across the whole image), outputs at 4K, supports HDR10, and displays at 60 Hz. You'll also find three HDMI ports on the TV for plugging in additional devices.</p><p>While there's nothing here to really set the onn. apart from a lot of its competitors, they're a&nbsp;great option at this price point, especially if you just want a TV you can set-up in your spare room.</p><h5 class=display-card-title>onn. 65-Inch</h5><span>Budget Choice</span><p class=display-card-description>An inexpensive TV that still outputs a solid picture.</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">Shop Now</a> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=small-and-simplistic-hisense-h4>Small and Simplistic: Hisense H4</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/d0096ec6-5.jpg> Hisense<p>If you're looking for an inexpensive TV that won't eat up an entire wall, the Hisense H4 is an excellent compromise. This relatively small display (43-inch) outputs at 1080p (except for the 32-inch model which only does 720p), has a 60 Hz refresh rate, and uses a standard LED display. It's nothing extravagant, but if you're looking for a simple Roku TV&nbsp;, the H4 is exactly that. No high-end features or fancy add-ons, just a standard TV with a solid display for the price.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/414lm9vkuwl-_sl500_.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Hisense H4 43-Inch</h5><span>Small and Simplistic</span><p class=display-card-description>A small and affordable display without any fancy features to get in the way.</p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$270 at Amazon</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhuam1kbHy1tMRma2aalajBbr7OpKxmrKaofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katy-perry-proves-no-bad-blood-taylor-swift-reunite-eras-tour.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift's close-up selfie sparks reaction as she poses with Katy Perry - proving there's no bad</span></a>
