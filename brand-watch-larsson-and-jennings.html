How would you characterize the influence of each?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We try to incorporate clean lines and a contemporary feel to every one of our watches in keeping with Sweden's famously minimalist design approach, which is one of our key inspirations. We add to that features from the classic British dress watch, like sculpted hands and a roman numeral marker, to create a simple and slimline watch suitable for both men and women.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>How do the series get their names?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Many are inspired by our Swedish roots - Läder for example, means Leather in Swedish, Kulör means colour.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Which watch style is your most popular right now?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://shop.harpersbazaar.com/designers/larsson-jennings/black-l-der-watch/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Läder | Black" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Läder | Black</a> is our signature and best-selling style as it's so incredibly versatile. Customers have really been stocking up on the CM styles too, often buying both gold and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://shop.harpersbazaar.com/designers/larsson-jennings/silver-chain-metal-watch/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=silver class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">silver</a> to go with their different jewellery options.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Which style is your personal favorite?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I actually have most of our collection but usually switch between three styles : the Läder | Black or the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://shop.harpersbazaar.com/designers/larsson-jennings/gold-chain-metal-watch/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CM | Gold" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">CM | Gold</a> for every day, or the Saxon | Gold when I feel like making a bolder statement.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Who is the quintessential Larsson & Jennings watch wearer?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The beauty of the watches is that they cater for a wide variety of people, so though we design with a 25+ fashion-conscious creative in mind, we're seeing many customers outside that description who react to them just as well. Opening our first brick-and-mortar store in London has shown us the wide range of the customers we have, which is just one of the reasons we hope to open more over the coming year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>What's your style philosophy for accessorizing with a watch? What's the chicest <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://shop.harpersbazaar.com/in-the-magazine/one-to-watch/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="way to wear it" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">way to wear it</a>?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My watch has now become my main accessory so i chop and change the style to go with what I'm wearing. I'm not one for wearing lots of bracelets so i wear it on its own and let my watch do all the talking. It's amazing to see how many compliments you get.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>What makes Larsson & Jennings watches so unique in the market?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The mix of good price, great quality (all watches are Swiss made, with Swiss Ronda movements inside) and minimalist design make them a great understated, statement accessory suitable for people with so many different styles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>What are the key focus points for the brand?</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Simple, beautiful and functional are keywords for us. Aesthetic is hugely important but we don't put style over substance; we want to ensure the best possible quality for an accessible price, which is why all our watches are Swiss Made, topped with crystal sapphire glass and teamed with straps handmade from beautiful but hard-wearing leathers we source from tanneries in Sweden and England.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Considering the predominance of smartphones as the go-to time teller, how do you explain the surge in popularity of wristwatches?<br></strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Watches used to be either a practical necessity or a status item but with the rise of the smartphone, that necessity has waned. Now, for some people, they're a statement of style instead—just another great fashion accessory to demonstrate one's taste. We try to design for those who actually use them to tell the time, as well as those who don't.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>What is next for the brand?<br></strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">2015 is going to be a great year for us, with more colorways coming to our Classic collections, a handful of exciting collaborations with both UK and USA based brands, two new brick-and-mortar stores and a new series coming out before the end of the year—watch this space.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/90c7be36-7ec0-48af-bc29-cd00991f9c44.jpg alt="Headshot of Sarah Lindig" title="Headshot of Sarah Lindig" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Sarah Lindig is the senior digital editor, overseeing special projects for Harper's Bazaar.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWiclai2qLrEq6pomWFlfXGFjpupmqaUYsSiwMKhZKWZoqjAsLqMmqWdZZqau6%2B1zaCqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ingrid-andress-good-person-tour-dates-2023.html><span>←</span><span>Ingrid Andress Plans Global 'The Good Person Tour' for 2023</span></a>
