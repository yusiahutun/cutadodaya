That is a whole separate company.” He added that while he listed his company under those categories, “there was never a plan to raise yaks for meat in the beginning. I know some people can’t fathom that and want to say I’m a liar,” Star said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While we wait for the next Jeffree Star drama to come along, let’s take a look at his humongous net worth – reported to be around US$200 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, although the evidence we’ve gathered below suggests the reality could be far higher.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Jeffree Star Cosmetics grosses US$100-150 million annually</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/10/9bb18616-f6b3-41f3-a913-4313acbd63d1_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Orange County native gained his beauty cult following from his early days on MySpace where he used to post make-up tips. In 2014, he founded his eponymous cosmetic line using up his life savings, and was one of the first personalities to use YouTube to self-brand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After gaining millions of views from his MUA (make up artist) tutorials and music videos, Star leveraged the momentum to launch a string of beauty products, including liquid lipsticks, lip scrubs, highlighter palettes and eyeshadow pallets, among other items.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/10/23cb6c41-67b0-41dc-950e-8a87d8de323d_d7491f3d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2018, Star launched his line in shopping malls, and today he can earn up to US$5.2 million per product launch.

The total land is 70 acres, but his spacious house covers 6,000 square feet of it and includes “six bedrooms, a sizeable eat-in chef’s kitchen that opens into a family room, and another cosy den connecting the open-plan living and dining area and the main suite,” according to Architectural Digest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/06/10/55ccbd51-54d6-47a5-b500-62b1594943f3_952608ba.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also stated in a tweet that he has no interest in moving to the ranch full-time: “I’m never gonna leave Hidden Hills!
