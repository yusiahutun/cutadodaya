Four years ago, Travis appeared as a guest on his Whiskey Ginger podcast. Everything went well and all was filmed until the editor started doing his job.</p><p>“My editor calls me, and he’s like, ‘bro, I don’t know how to tell you this, but Travis was falling out of his shorts’,” Santino revealed as the Chiefs star burst into laughter.</p><p>“I was like ‘What do you mean falling out of his shorts?'” Adam recalled asking his podcast editor, who responded “‘His boys were sliding out.'” Awkward…</p><p>Instead of going through the effort to reshoot, the Ricky Stanicky star had the clever idea of covering the ‘inappropriate areas’ with a <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a> logo whenever they were visible.</p><p>Ending on a joke the <a href=#>movie</a> star said they were “going to sell that footage for a lot of money someday.”</p><p>“No wonder you wear underwear now,” brother <a href=#>Jason Kelce</a> exclaimed. Luckily, the former Philadelphia Eagles star has never had that problem, despite admitting he <a href=#>only wears underwear when working out</a>. Yep, the rest of the time he goes commando.</p><p>Nice…</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-and-taylor-are-reportedly-planning-a-family-vacay-so-he-better-pack-his-underwear>Travis Kelce and Taylor are reportedly planning a family vacay – so he better pack his underwear</h2><p>It’s been reported that the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> are taking their families on an ‘epic European trip’ as the Bad Blood singer gears up the European segment of her Eras Tour next month.</p><p>An insider <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tells</a> the US Sun that Ed and Donna Kelce, as well as Taylor’s parents, and Jason will be involved in the trip, popping in here and there.</p><p>“The plan is for the families to link up at the beginning of May for the four-show run in France and will stay until May 30,” the source claims.</p><p>“Once the four dates in Paris are over, they are thinking of heading for some culinary and visual delights in Tuscany, before setting off for Sweden where four gigs are planned at Stockholm’s Friends Arena.”</p><p>The NFL star is planning to stay on as the tour heads back to France and the United Kingdom, including <a href=#>eight dates at Wembley Arena</a>, the source reveals, while the rest of the family heads back to the States.</p><p>“They have been talking about it for a while now and they all are so excited for this Euro trip,” the insider added. “It’s a great time and opportunity to get to know each other’s families more.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2eBcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGaYr6eZmcBuscybmKuqkajArrHNrWSanqSav26yzquenqyknruoedSnm56qp5qus3nOp2SappSnsrh50pqlraGepMBuvM6dmpqrpGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./little-black-dress-trend.html><span>←</span><span>Inside The Evolution of the Little Black Dress Trend of Fall 2023</span></a>
