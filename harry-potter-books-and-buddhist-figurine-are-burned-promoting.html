Rowling.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They were all brought in by parishioners, who were encouraged by the priests to clear their homes of objects that had evil forces. Influential in Poland, the Catholic Church objects to Harry Potter books, which are international bestsellers, saying the stories about the boy wizard promote sorcery.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the photos, priests and altar boys can be seen watching the burning objects.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The foundation said the book burning was intended to alert parishioners to bad influences that it says come from magic and the occult.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many comments under the Facebook postings condemned the event, recalling book burnings in Nazi Germany before World War II. Some said this taught hatred and asked if the next in line for burning were witches, like in the Middle Ages.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/04/02/e41b4558-54d7-11e9-a3ae-f2742b367090_972x_080737.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The event was criticised by the Reverend Wojciech Parafianowicz, spokesman for the diocese of Koszalin, where the foundation is based, who said he “did not like this form of priestly activity, which is wrong.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But, speaking with the wpolityce.pl news portal, Parafianowicz also said that the occult and magic “have a bad influence on human life.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A popular commentator on religion, Pawel Guzynski, a Dominican Friar, said on Facebook the burning was “the fall of wise faith [rather] than of unwise superstition.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The church enjoys great authority in predominantly Catholic Poland because of its historical and political backing. It has the support of the conservative government many of whose members are Catholic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXymwdGop55nkafBqq%2FLnmZsaGBpf3KEjqGYq6qpYr2wwNOeqWaan6S4tHnAp5tmmqWZsam10q1kn6GXqr%2BqusRmmKudXZfCs7rEnWSpqp%2BivLW1zaA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nino-tempo-musician.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Nino Tempo dating?
