The transgender former head boy of a £30,000-a-year boarding school died after a drug-fuelled party two days before getting the go-ahead for his gender reassignment operation.
Synestra De Courcy, 23, was born male and went on to become head boy and twice student of the year at St Christopher school in Letchworth, Hertfordshire.
She officially became Synestra in 2013 and hoped to undergo a full operation, but difficulties with the NHS caused her to spiral into drug addiction, according to her mother."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
