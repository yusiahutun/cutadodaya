The news outlet reported airlines and hotel prices have gone up four times of the normal price during the Eras Tour in Australia.</p><p>Examples of the alleged price gouging include flight tickets, where normally a one way ticket from Brisbane to Sydney that costs $120 usually, is now priced at more than $400 in February 23. Hotel prices have also gone up. A night at Novotel Sydney that generally costs around $700 has reportedly increased to $1200 for the Eras tour nights themselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1526784902-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-s-projected-influence-on-europe-s-economy>Taylor Swift’s projected influence on Europe’s economy</h2><p>While the price gouging remains a problem that needs to be addressed, financial experts are crunching numbers to project what sort of influence the <a href=#>music</a> legend might have on European economy.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> will be performing in 18 European cities this year, and reports from various regions are already predicting the rush of tourists, which will help boost the travel sector of the cities.</p><p>Hotel research firm&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">STR</a>&nbsp;revealed the demand of hotel bookings in the UK where hotels in Cardiff and Liverpool had already reached occupancy levels of more than 50% in August 2023 for her upcoming tour dates. Tay Tay will be stopping by these cities in June – so fans booked up almost a year in advance.</p><p>Vacation rental data firm&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AirDNA</a> further added demand for short-term rentals during Swift’s tour dates. In Vienna rooms were up 1,989% year-on-year and in Warsaw, Poland, it went up 2020%.</p><p>1989? We see the numbers match T.
