Later the same day, he was released on bail of $35,000.&nbsp;</p><h2>John Is A Changed Man Now?</h2><p>Despite his run-ins with law and series of controversies, Gabbana, 25, is a completely changed man now as he has started believing in god and releasing gospel rap music to convince his fans that the former Boonk Gang is now a changed man for real.&nbsp;</p><p>As an inmate, John shared the story and narrated how his time in jail had benefitted him via a video.&nbsp;He continued,</p><p>"It was a humbling experience. Because.. learning about the power of Jesus and how humble he was with so much power, he had really made me humble myself. Knowing how much fame I had but how I carried myself.
