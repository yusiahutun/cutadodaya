However, since Eden was still 17 at the time, the two didn’t reveal their relationship until a year later.</span></p><p><span>Prior to Eden, Gil dated Sofia Richie (Lionel Richie’s daughter) for a while in early 2021. The two were first spotted publicly locking lips in Miami in January of that year.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, we don’t know why or when Gil and Eden broke up.</span></p><p><span>Now, coming to the rumor about Eden possibly being romantically linked with&nbsp; Leonardo DiCaprio. It’s been debunked! The two were only seated together at an EP release party for Ebony Riley in Los Angeles in Feb 2023, nothing more.</span></p><p><span>Shedding light on the matter, an insider said, “There is zero truth to this. He was seated next to [Eden] at a music party, along with many other people. It’s just silly. Leo clearly can’t be dating every single person that [he’s] in a room with.”</span></p><p><i><span>The Wolf of Wall Street </span></i><span>star split up with Camila Morrone, after 4 years of a relationship in 2022. Since then, he has reportedly had relationships with other women, including Gigi Hadid and Victoria Lamas.</span></p><p><span>In September 2022, Leo and Gigi were first seen together at a Casa Cipriani party for New York Fashion Week. A film source said at the time that the two “like each other and are having a nice time.” Leo, who has known Gigi for years but only in a casual way, was “taken with Gigi,” the industry source continued. “She is the type of woman he is usually attracted to.”</span></p><p><span>According to our source, Leo is not currently involved in anything major romantically.</span></p><h3><b>Gil Ofer Age</b></h3><p><span>Gil Ofer was 31 years of age in 2023.</span></p><p><span>He is 12 years older than Eden Polani.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Gil Ofer Parents?</b></h3><p><span>Gil Ofer’s parents are one of the richest people in Israel.
