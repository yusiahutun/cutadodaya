Eva is the mom of her little girls alongside longtime partner Ryan Gosling. Though the two sparked engagement rumors when the Ghost Rider alum flashed a huge diamond on her ring finger during a family hike in late January 2021, Eva and the Notebook actor have yet to confirm whether they tied the knot.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>No cats life for Croatias Anastasia, 17, as palace eviction sparks storm and petition</h2><time>Mar 18, 2024</time>
