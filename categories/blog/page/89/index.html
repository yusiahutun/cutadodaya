JACKSONVILLE, FL (CelebrityAccess) – A small unassuming house in Jacksonville was officially minted “the birthplace of the Allman Brothers Band” over the weekend.
Derek Trucks, nephew of founding member Butch Trucks, helped to unveil a historical marker out front of the home during a community ceremony on Saturday.
The plaque, which reads “A group of musicians held a jam session at ‘The Gray House’ on March 23, 1969,” was revealed on the 50th anniversary of that momentous first session – an occasion during which Duane Allman reportedly barred the doorway announcing that anyone present not willing to be in his band would have to fight their way out.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Las Vegas realtor Joe Junio 'filmed shooting pastor Nick Davi dead in front of his family' posted st</h2><time>May 14, 2024</time>
