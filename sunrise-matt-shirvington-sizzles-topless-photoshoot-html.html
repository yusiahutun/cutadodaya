A rare photo has resurfaced of the former Olympic sprinter's long-forgotten modelling campaign for Jockey underwear.
The black-and-white image, released in the early 2000s, shows the handsome athlete wearing nothing but black underpants as he straddles a horse.
His ripped physique and famous bulge were on display in the racy image, which has almost been wiped from the internet in recent years - perhaps due&nbsp;to efforts by Seven's publicity department."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
