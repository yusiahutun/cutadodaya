photos of genitals of the men of with whom she was sleeping.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She also reportedly made the woman share hotel rooms with her while traveling and in New York, would require her to sleepover her apartment, which she described made her feel uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There, Guilfoyle would often undress herself in front of her employee and even

married to California Governor Gavin Newsom, encouraged her assistant to sleep with rich and powerful men.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A former Fox colleague, who was not named, said her behavior had fostered an environment 'that was detrimental to young women.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It was worse than gross—it put other women at Fox in such a terrible
