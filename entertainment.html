Confused yet? Wait, there's more. After thousands of years of calculations, mathematicians figured out that Pi is always, no matter how big the circle, just about 3.14. In other words, the circumference of a circle is without exception a little more than 3.14 times its diameter. But pi is also happens to be a number without end...we just round it to 3.14, which is why it's celebrated on March 14. Of course, it's thanks to the name we get to eat as much pie as we want. Which kind of makes up for the whole math thing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-x6js8g et3p2gv0">So this March 14, as you sit around the table chowing down on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/g1411/pizza-recipes/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=pizza class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">pizza</a> pie and dessert pie (we like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/g957/chocolate-pie-recipes/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=chocolate class="body-link css-a3mbhf et3p2gv0">chocolate</a>) with the family, you might want to give the following puns and one liners a shot. Goofy as they are, they're just about guaranteed to give everyone a good case of the giggles, math nerds or not.</p><img alt="pi day cherry and apple pies" title="Pi Day Cherry and Apple Pies" width=2123 height=1417 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pi-day-cherry-and-apple-pies-royalty-free-image-1644606991.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd2">Mizina</span><span class="css-7spg7x e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-1lk26yx e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span></p><ul data-node-id=5 class="css-9wvcvc et3p2gv0"><li>What do you get when you cut a jack-o’-lantern by its diameter?
