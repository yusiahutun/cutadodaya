While Aries is impulsive and competitive, Virgo is overthinking and sensitive, so it could feel like they don't have much of anything in common. However, Aries does respect Virgo's ability to organize and create structure. At the same time, Virgo might find Aries' ability to act and then think mesmerizing, so they might very well end up inspiring one another.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-virgo-and-taurus-compatibility--ideal-match></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Virgo and Taurus Compatibility — Ideal Match</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taurus</a>, the fixed earth sign, and Virgo are trine, or four signs apart, which is the most harmonious and easy-breezy angle that two signs can make to one another. Both earth signs are grounded and pragmatic. Both happy to tend to and create a tranquil home and relationship, Venus-ruled Taurus beautifies while Mercury-ruled Virgo preps, plans, and organizes. Together, they're a productive, stable, and sensual pair.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-virgo-and-gemini-compatibility--problematic-pair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Virgo and Gemini Compatibility — Problematic Pair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Gemini</a>, the mutable air sign, and Virgo are three signs apart, or square, which is thought of as a tense but potentially activating angle. Sharing mutability, both Gemini and Virgo are adaptable but also indecisive, so they can frustrate one another by mirroring that tendency — and Virgo's sensitivity and meticulousness can feel like a buzzkill to free-spirited Gemini. Still, they're also both ruled by mental Mercury, so they'll, at the very least, find it easy to connect on an intellectual, platonic level.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-virgo-and-cancer-compatibility--ideal-match></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Virgo and Cancer Compatibility — Ideal Match</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Virgo is sextile, or two signs apart, from&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cancer</a>, the cardinal water sign and fourth sign of the zodiac, which means they share a natural, friendly connection. Cancer and Virgo are sensitive, service-oriented caregivers who are happiest when giving to others. They're both equally motivated to turn big-picture dreams into reality and enjoy being the shoulder the other one leans on while striving toward their end game. Cancer can learn from and admire Virgo's intellectual approach, while the Crab can teach the Maiden how to tune into their intuition.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-virgo-and-leo-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Virgo and Leo Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Leo</a>, the fifth sign of the zodiac and the fixed&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>fire sign</a>, is semisextile, or one sign apart from Virgo, which might make for a bit of bumpiness because they have slightly different perspectives and priorities. While action-oriented Leo prefers to prowl, roar, and stalk down any objective in a dynamic, take-charge, mutable, Mercury-ruled Virgo is all about researching and gathering the most pertinent details before making a move. That pace — and Virgo's mutable indecisiveness — can frustrate a go-getter Lion. But if they can be open to learning from one another's unique approach, these two can be a supremely supportive duo.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-virgo-and-virgo-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Virgo and Virgo Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A Virgo-Virgo pairing serves double the Mercury-ruled, detail-oriented, research-savvy energy, which can be a total boon or a buzzkill for this pairing. Virgos tend to be their worst critics, and if they see a characteristic they don't exactly adore reflected back to them by their Virgo partner, it could feel like a real turnoff. On the positive side, these two will have no problem thinking and talking through every single tedious plan they tackle together.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-virgo-and-libra-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Virgo and Libra Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Libra</a>, the seventh sign of the zodiac and the cardinal air sign, is semisextile, or one sign apart from Virgo, which can make for a little bit of misunderstanding and discomfort. With these two, seeing eye-to-eye isn't all that tough. Sure, Libra can be indecisive and flighty, but mutable Virgo has plenty of their own hemming-and-hawing moments, too. Both are eager to solve or smooth over other people's — or one another's problems — and enjoy making their shared space clean and pretty.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-virgo-and-scorpio-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Virgo and Scorpio Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Scorpio</a>, the eighth sign of the zodiac and the fixed water sign, is sextile, or two signs apart, from Virgo, which can make for calm waters. Both tend to be pretty reserved, loyal, deep thinkers, although Scorpio's more in their feelings — and more interested in stepping into a position of power — than heady, serviceable Virgo. Yet this difference can make them a duo to be reckoned with, as they'll work in a diligent, calculated way together toward their shared, ideal endgame.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-virgo-and-sagittarius-compatibility--problematic-pair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Virgo and Sagittarius Compatibility — Problematic Pair</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sagittarius</a>, the ninth sign of the zodiac and the mutable fire sign, is square, or three signs apart from Virgo, setting up a challenging relationship that could require a lot of work and patience. Jupiter-ruled, gung-ho Sag's whole M.O. is to speak (or preach) and then think, while Virgo will split hairs over&nbsp;the exact right word&nbsp;before, during, and after they deliver what they hope is a thoroughly researched, fact-based statement. In turn, the Archer can strike the Maiden as insensitive and priggish, while the Maiden feels like an uptight, overthinking pain to the Archer. If the fire sign is open to considering the details, and the earth sign wants more adventure in their lives, they've come to the right match.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-virgo-and-capricorn-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Virgo and Capricorn Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Capricorn</a>, the 10th sign of the zodiac and the cardinal earth sign, is trine, or four signs apart from Virgo, making for a natural, industrious bond. Both earth signs are wired to take care of business, and while Cap is striving toward publicly-recognized respect and achievement, Virgo is happy to handle the day-to-day details. They're equally pragmatic, hardworking, and grounded in reality, which means that together, they can build something lasting and satisfying.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-virgo-and-aquarius-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Virgo and Aquarius Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Aquarius</a>, the 11th sign of the zodiac and the fixed&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>air sign</a>, is quincunx, or five signs apart from Virgo, which is generally considered a rather awkward angle. While Aquarius is obsessed with what's happening on a universal scale and Virgo's totally in the weeds, these two can find common ground regarding their big, humanitarian hearts, rational mindsets, and personability. Aquarius can introduce Virgo to the nonprofit or campaign they're deeply committed to, and Virgo can come up with a step-by-step action plan for making real progress.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-virgo-and-pisces-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Virgo and Pisces Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Pisces</a>, the 12th sign of the zodiac and mutable water sign, is opposite (or six signs apart from) Virgo, which makes for an extremely yin-yang pairing. Ruled by dreamy Neptune, the Fish is deeply spiritual, empathic, artistic, and emotional, all of which can be very inspiring — or very confusing and disorienting — to rational, grounded, and orderly Virgo. If they're willing to learn how to speak one another's language, the combo of Pisces' spiritual water and Virgo's practical earth lays down fertile ground for a bond that flourishes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8Csq6unnKS0unvVoqmgp12YvK68wK2gm6GcnsG6</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5-pieces-luxury-exercise-equipment-level-your-workout-diors.html><span>←</span><span></span></a>
