You've probably encountered plenty of error messages over the years, but some are puzzling and difficult to bypass. Google's "unusual traffic from your computer network" is one of them. So what is it? And what can you do about it?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-google-39-s-quot-unusual-traffic-quot-error-message>What Is Google's "Unusual Traffic" Error Message?</h2><p>Google's Unusual Traffic error can occur in any browser or device. You'll encounter it when you type a query into Google's search box and hit search or use the address bar to find what you're looking for (if Google is set as your default search engine). It states:</p><p>Our systems have detected unusual traffic from your computer network. This page checks to see if it's really you sending the requests, and not a robot.</p><p>When you get this error message, your IP (Internet Protocol) address is displayed below, and there's also a timestamp showing when it occurred. To continue browsing, you need to solve the CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) and verify that you are not a robot.</p><p>You might also get a message that reads:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This network is blocked due to unaddressed abuse complaints about malicious behavior. This page checks to see if it's really a human sending the requests and not a robot coming from this network.</p><p>There are several other variations, but the point of Google's "unusual traffic from your computer network" error messages is that it thinks you're a bot or a malicious actor. To confirm you are neither, Google asks you to solve a quick puzzle. This is a standard security measure employed by countless websites and online services.</p><p>Solving a CAPTCHA every now and again is not an issue in and of itself. But here's the problem: more often than not, the error message will persist even if you <a href=#>solve the CAPTCHA</a>. It will appear every time you try to use Google search, making browsing incredibly difficult and forcing you to use a different and potentially less accurate search engine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-you-39-re-getting-the-quot-unusual-traffic-quot-error-message>Why You're Getting the "Unusual Traffic" Error Message</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/google-abuse-complaints.jpg><p>There are seven possible reasons why you might be getting this annoying error message. Though most are benign, getting this prompt could also be a sign of a security breach.</p><h3 id=googling-too-quickly>1. Googling Too Quickly</h3><p>You may receive the "unusual traffic" message because you are too fast for Google, rapidly inputting different search terms. When you do this repeatedly for a prolonged period, Google might misinterpret your activity as that of a programmed bot.</p><h3 id=using-automated-software>2. Using Automated Software</h3><p>You might get this error message if you're using automated software of some kind. For example, a keyword research tool that scrapes queries people enter into Google's search box or similar software that Search Engine Optimization (SEO) professionals rely on to do their jobs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=sharing-your-network-with-other-people>3. Sharing Your Network With Other People</h3><p>You might get the "unusual traffic" error message when using a public Wi-Fi—because many other people are likely connected to the same network and searching Google, the software might flag the requests as automated. This can also happen when several people are using your home network at the same time.</p><h3 id=using-a-vpn>4. Using a VPN</h3><p>Browsing the web through Virtual Private Network (VPN) software or using a proxy browser plugin can sometimes result in Google showing you the "unusual traffic" error message and demanding you solve a CAPTCHA. For example, using the Tor Browser and attempting to use Google search can result in an "unusual traffic" error as your request is routed through various addresses. Google takes that to mean something dodgy is going on and presents the error message.</p><h3 id=using-certain-extensions>5. Using Certain Extensions</h3><p>Some browser extensions might also trick Google into believing the traffic coming from your network is not organic, particularly extensions that send automated queries, or at least appear to. Web scraping extensions and extensions used for SEO research come to mind.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=your-software-is-outdated>6. Your Software Is Outdated</h3><p>You may be getting this error message because your software is outdated. Perhaps your VPN hasn't been updated in a while, or your browsers is too old, so Google suspects suspicious and bot-like behavior.</p><h3 id=you-39-re-under-attack>7. You're Under Attack</h3><p>When there's an unusual issue with your internet connection or device that is refusing to go away, there's always the possibility a threat actor or malware (that is, malicious software) is to blame.</p><h2 id=how-to-fix-the-quot-unusual-traffic-from-your-computer-network-quot-error>How to Fix the "Unusual Traffic From Your Computer Network" Error</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/unusual-traffic-error-fix.jpg><p>Now that you know what might be causing this error message, it's time to address the root cause. The good news is that you most likely have nothing to worry about. If you are searching too quickly or using a keyword research tool, you can solve the issue by clearing the browser cache, history, and cookies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li>If you're using a Chromium-based desktop browser such as Chrome, Edge, or Opera, the easiest and quickest way is to press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Delete</strong>. Once you do that, a pop-up menu will appear. Here, you can select which items to clear. The same shortcut also works in Safari and Mozilla Firefox.</li><li>The process is somewhat more complicated on mobile devices but practically identical on all browsers. To clear cache and cookies, you need to access the browser's <strong>Settings</strong> menu and navigate to <strong>Clear browsing data</strong> or <strong>Clear History and Website Data</strong>.</li></ul><p>Now, if you suspect a VPN, proxy, or other software on your device is to blame, simply disable them and see if the error message goes away. If that fails, try restarting your modem or router manually. Unplug it, wait a few minutes, and then plug it back in. Alternatively, you can press the reset button on the back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you believe a browser extension is to blame, disable or remove it. If you're using Chrome (or a similar, Chromium-based browser), click the little puzzle icon in the address bar, locate the extension that might be causing this issue, and disable or remove it. In Firefox, you can do the same by clicking the menu button (the three bars) and navigating to <strong>Add-ons and Themes > Extensions</strong>.</p><p>Now, here's the bad news: if none of the above worked, your security might be compromised. This is the case if you notice other signs of a malware infection or security compromise: lagging, overheating, system crashes, pop-up messages, advertisements, and so on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some malware is difficult to detect and works in the background, sending repeated requests and thus making your traffic seem automated or unusual to Google, which could explain the "unusual traffic" error message. But there are still ways to remove it. If you don't have malware protection, download it immediately—there are plenty of <a href=#>free antivirus tools</a> to choose between. Once you've installed anti-malware, scan your computer.</p><p>If you think your Android phone has malware, you should <a href=#>try removing the malware</a> instead of immediately performing a factory reset, which will restore your smartphone to its initial state.</p><p>It is highly unlikely that your iPhone is infected with malware, especially if it is not jailbroken, but you <a href=#>should still check iOS devices</a> just in case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With all that said, there is a small chance that your entire network is compromised. If you suspect this to be the case, the first thing you should do is scan it for any potential issues. There are several ways to <a href=#>manually check if your network is secure</a> and protect it if it's not.</p><h2 id=get-rid-of-the-quot-unusual-traffic-quot-error-once-and-for-all>Get Rid of the "Unusual Traffic" Error Once and for All</h2><p>In most cases, Google's "unusual traffic" error is nothing to worry about and can be bypassed. It is still very annoying, however, so it's good to know how to get rid of it when it pops up.</p><p>But whether you're getting error messages or not, you're only as safe as the network you're connected to. Fortunately, even if you're not great with computers, you can easily secure your home Wi-Fi in just a few minutes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGieqKeXobJuwc2uqq6ZnGLBs63Fn6CcZZWnv7C%2BjJ%2BgsWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cutout-dress-trends-summer-2023-7507004.html><span>←</span><span>The Most Surprising Cutout Dresses Celebrities Are Wearing in 2023</span></a>
