This season, 18 players are fighting to win the title of Sole Survivor and a grand cash prize of $1 million.</p><p>According to ew.com, Ryan’s favorite hobbies are fishing, hiking, and carpentry and his pet peeves are bullies, laziness, and self-entitlement.</p><p>Since his birth, Ryan Medrano had to find his own way to solve things. Born with cerebral palsy, doctors said he wouldn’t be able to walk. Despite the odds against him, Ryan learned to walk and converse with people after four years of therapy.</p><p>Ryan always had to read body language and facial expressions to anticipate the next moves. He believes this skill will help him read people well and tell when they’re lying in Survivor.</p><p>In an interview with Parade.com, Ryan revealed why he was on Survivor.
