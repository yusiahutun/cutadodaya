The University of Florida’s Musical Storytelling with Taylor Swift and Other Iconic Female Artists will examine the <a href=#>music</a> star’s “evergreen” songwriting. Other artists that students will learn about and investigate include Dolly Parton, Billie Holiday, and Aretha Franklin.</p><p>From her <a href=#>work ethic on her record-breaking Eras Tour</a> to a fiercely dedicated fan base (known as Swifties) it’s no surprise that Taylor Swift would have her own university courses worldwide. Though she isn’t alone, other <a href=#>celebrities</a> have had classes and courses taught on them and their careers, including <a href=#>Harry Styles</a> and Nicki Minaj.</p><p>Talking about her excitement at teaching the course in Harvard, Burt <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> The Harvard Crimson: “We are lucky enough to be living in a time when one of our major artists is also one of the most famous people on the planet.

To use it for what?”</p><p>Another penned: “This will be historic but is it really needed ? Taylor Swift is a Queen and one of the GOATs, but I really don’t think this is needed. Just my opinion.”</p><p>A third said: “It seems like every elite college in the US is only offering a Taylor Swift themed course for clout.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-and-travis-kelce-share-values>Taylor and Travis Kelce share values</h2><p>Taylor and her NFL-playing man <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> have been on everyone’s radar for the past couple of months. The 33-year-old has often discussed the <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> publicly, but now he’s been even more open. He shared that <a href=#>Taylor’s values are “right up his alley.”</a></p><p>In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, he explained: “Everybody knows I’m a family guy. Her team is her family. Her family does a lot of stuff in terms of the tour, the marketing, being around, so I think she has a lot of those values as well, which is right up my alley.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift’s feelings are normal but the same can’t be said for Travis Kelce</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2eFcLTAq62aqpRivKeyxKuqZqaVrHq1rdilpqtlo6y2p8CMnKauqqOaeqPB02admqajYq60t4yinWahpKG5br7EmqOlsV2dsq28jKyrrpyVo8G0ecinZK2glWK5sLrGZqmupl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./francesco-clemente-0416.html><span>←</span><span>Francesco Clemente Paints Supermodels for Harper's Bazaar</span></a>
