Almost immediately after their mom Jaqi posted the first few photos, they began to bring in tens of thousands of followers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The family never thought their pictures would be anything but them modeling, but then Kevin got sick in October.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The father of three and head swim coach at JSerra Catholic High School in San Juan Capistrano, California, started feeling "a little bit of a cold" coming on, he recalls. It never occurred to him that it could be something serious.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">His symptoms worsened over the next few weeks, and on Oct. 30 doctors gave him the frightening diagnosis: a rare, aggressive cancer called T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That," says Clements, 39, "is when everything changed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For more on the Clements, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>subscribe now to PEOPLE</a> or pick up this week's issue.</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>The Clements twins.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Kevin is currently going through this second of 12 rounds of chemotherapy, he and his family are on a desperate — and hopeful — search for a life-saving bone marrow transplant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ava and Leah <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>turned to their 1.5 million followers</a> to help find their dad a match — a long shot but his best hope for a cure.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We can put it out there to so many people how easy it is to see if you're a match and how you can help," says Kevin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The twins, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>who are helping with bone marrow drives sponsored by DKMS</a>, the world's largest bone marrow donor center, are glad that they — and their fans — can do their part.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"If he gets a transplant, his cancer will go away quicker," says Ava.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adds Leah: "People are so sweet to want to help my dad. The more people that get tested the better."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The family says that even if they don't find Kevin a match, they know they can help some of the 12,000 others in urgent need of bone marrow transplants. The simple test to find out if you're a match is a cheek swab, and the actual procedure, if you end up becoming a match, is painless.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We can help spread awareness so that more people decide to become donors," says Jaqi, who has spent every night at the hospital with Kevin. "There's just so much you could do with this platform. And it's taken about two years to build, but I think we can really get out there and help a lot of people. That's our new focus right now."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Adds Kevin: "At the end of the day, life needs to move forward. There's so much love out there. I've gotten text messages, emails, and phone calls from people who I haven't heard from since college. It has helped our family really deal with it in a very positive way."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iquqK6jKKlrZ2imsC1e8inqq2Zl6eurnnSrZirq12Yuaa5xKerrGWkrLavv4ydmJ1lkqS7pnnMmqmrp6diwbOtzaynpZmeqXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bed-rotting-hottest-tiktok-self-care-trend.html><span>←</span><span>'Bed Rotting' Is Hottest Self-Care Trend For Gen Z</span></a>
